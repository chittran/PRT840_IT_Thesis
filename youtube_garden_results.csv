It was founded ...",,"(soft guitar music) - G'day, we're here today with Alex at the beautiful North
Brighton Community Garden. Thanks for having us, Alex and looking forward to
exploring the place here. Can you tell us a little
bit about where we are? - So we are in North Brighton, that is about a five minute
drive from the beach. So I guess we are in a bit
of a coastal community. We're in Kaurna Country here and we're in-between the busy roads of Brighton road and Diagonal road. So, you can find us here just
off the side of Bowker Oval. We've got Bowker straight
across the front of our garden and we get a lot of
people using this park. A lot of people coming by and having a look through our garden. So, I think we should go check it out. - Yeah, Alex, am I right in thinking this was a tennis court,
only a few years ago? - Yeah, so when we
first came to this site, it was a tennis court. It wasn't being used. There wasn't a fence or
nets or anything like that. But it did have bitumen. So that was something to
think about whether or not we were going to plant
on top of the bitumen or rip it all up. And we did choose to rip the bitumen up. And so now we're in a process
of regenerating the soil and regenerating the land that we grow on. And that was really quite important to us. So taking, I guess,
seemingly disused space and turning it into something
that could have multiple uses. - You were 19 when you took this on. - I would have been around 19, when I guess I had some crazy idea to start a community garden. It took three years to find land. So I guess when we did
eventually find this space, I was around 23. And between starting
and finding this space, we were in talks with the council. We went through a few different
community consultations, defined the perfect area that, you know, everyone was happy for us to grow on and start this garden. So it was a journey, definitely. - So the garden here is built upon the permaculture principles? - Yes, so that was a huge influence in the design of the garden and the ethos of the community garden. I think more than anything,
we wanted a context to set the community garden
into something that, you know a lot of people already know about. So permaculture is a
set of design principles where you place yourself within nature, you're not a part of nature. You're not separate to it. It's about holistic systems. Nothing is segregated,
everything is interconnected. And that's very much
what we wanted to have at the forefront of what we do. So, I think it was very much
about thinking, you know the small actions that
we do here are going to have a ripple effect outward. It's going to make a difference. So permaculture, the
three, I think, what is it? Yeah, ethos of earth care,
people care and fresh air, very much guided what we did and do. - You can feel that as you
walk through the garden. - Yeah, Oh, that's lovely. - It's amazing. - Yeah, yeah. - You must feel that with
the community members that you meet and you can see the benefits. - Yes, yep, I think so. I think, you know, I imagine that community gardens
are this reflexive space to many of the issues
that we are dealing with in today's modern society. So, I think that they are a response to a lot of the environmental
issues and social issues that we have. And it's a reminder that we are connected and the best way to connect is to be aware of how you grow your food. And I think that simple
action can have huge effects. - So one of the things I
love about your greenhouse, the reuse factor, talk
me through the design. - Yeah, so that was really
important to us that, you know where we can, we can source
locally and we can source from things that have
already had its life. And so we're giving it a new life. So, we do have the windows across the front which are all from salvage
yards and across here. - How did you go finding
all of the windows and making them fit? - Many trips to salvage yards. We're really lucky that we had Beau who could put
together the jigsaw puzzle on a computer instead
of having to, you know measure it out and do it all by hand. I think that very much helped. He was so skilled in doing that. - And it's stunning, you're
using it quite a lot. - Yes, so we use the
greenhouse all the time. We have two sort of big plant
sales throughout the year. And this is where we
grow all of the plants that we can then sell to
community garden members and also community members living by. - So in the greenhouse here, what have you got growing at the moment? - We have so many things. We have a lot of winter veg that we will then use for
our winter time plant sale. So primarily we do grow edibles that people can then grow
here or grow at home. And we'll often teach people how they can grow their produce at home. That's a really big
thing here, is education. So teaching that what
we do here in the garden can be replicated in your home, even if it's a very small courtyard garden or you're living on, you
know, multiple acres as well. Obviously every place
is going to be different and specific to where you're growing. But everyone can grow some of their food. - Absolutely. - So what we do here is we
do grow everything from seed, or we will propagate cuttings as well. So along this wall we've
got all growing from seed and that is really important to us. That ability to grow from seed and to have sovereignty
over the seeds that we grow. So knowing that where our
seeds are sourced from not selecting GMO seeds - Can I ask where do you source your seeds or do you save seeds? - We are trying to save seeds. We really want to save our seeds. Obviously we're still kind
of in our infancy here. So we haven't had too many
seasons to collect many seeds. But each year I know that we will slowly work up our seed bank and our seed library which we have in the shed. - So it's actually quite a big operation that you've got here. How does it work? - Yeah, so we have a managing group which is maybe around eight to ten people. So we all have our specific roles in that. And then we do have some
sub committees or groups. So we have a gardening
group and a compost crew, some people that are now taking charge of propagating and seed germination. And I hope eventually we'll
just have some more groups organically form as well as we figure out what
people are interested and what people want to do in this space. So I know at the moment, some wonderful ladies are starting up an arts and crafts group. And that way we can get
some beautiful artwork in the garden. And I think having that structure works. It's not too structured. Everything is mapped out and planned out but people still feel able
to take responsibility for the garden - Bringing their own inspiration. - Exactly. - And it's, yeah, it's a collective experience
what we're doing here. And so we really want
to foster that as well. - There's so many aspects to this garden, talk us through it. - Yeah, so we wanted it
to have so many aspects because it's going to
be a multi-use space. There's so many different
people using the space. Without spreading ourselves too thin, we did want to cater to,
you know, the diversity which is our community. So we do have the
sensory garden behind us. And anyone is able to walk
through throughout the day. We wanted it to be really
accessible and inclusive. And we do have our main path,
which is wheelchair friendly. So we wanted anyone with
sort of mobility challenges to still be able to enjoy this space. We have communal areas as well. So for a general membership,
you can use these areas. You can plant in these areas, pick small amounts from these
areas and look after it. And then we also do have
the individual plots that are in front of us and people can then rent these spaces and grow what they like in them. - So how did you establish these plots? - Yeah, so the timber that
we use is heat treated. It's not chemically treated,
so they're not lined. We didn't use any plastic in them which was very important to us. We did use the Hugelkultur method because it was something
a little bit different. So basically, it's this idea that you dump a whole heap of organic matter, like decomposing branches and logs into the centre of your bed. As they decompose, they release
nutrients into the soil, they increase water retention. - Love it. So a lot of this is slow solutions. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think a lot of
people do opt for wicking beds and that was something that
we did very much consider. For us, it was very resource intensive. And I know that obviously a huge perk of having the wicking beds is that you don't use so much water as a resource. And it's something that
we're considering now for some other beds. But we liked the idea of doing
something a bit different and giving it a shot. And so far, so good. - It's working, it's beautiful. - Yeah, so it's been fun to kind of yeah, do something different
and just give it a shot. - Well, Alex, I find it so inspiring that such a young woman of 19, it could take on such a
project and make it happen. How do you feel? - Thank you. I do feel very proud of, you know, it wasn't just me, obviously, but I do feel proud of what I've achieved and what the community has achieved. I think, you know, I
was thinking a lot prior to you guys coming down about this space and thinking why, you know,
why a community garden. And I think a lot of the time my answer is I don't really remember why. And I don't totally, I think I just thought it was a good idea. I think also, you know,
growing up young people, there's so much pressure
and a lot of overwhelm around the world that we're living in. There's a lot of stress that we're living in a
time of climate crisis. You know, social justice
issues are extreme. There's a lot of problems in the world. And I think that, you know, we can't accept that this is normal. I don't think it's how
people are meant to be. I think we're meant to be loving. We're meant to be in
communities more than ever. People are lonely. So why not have these spaces
where we can come together and yeah. And I think there are so
many young people reacting to the issues that we see. And I know that I'm not
alone in what I'm doing. And there are so many young people fighting and working for change and
the change will happen. And we have to change. And I'm very hopeful that we're going to see more
spaces like this come up. - Well, thank you so much for being part of that change
and inspiring that change. And would you have any
advice to young people wanting to start the foundations
for a community garden? - Yeah, and even older people. - Yeah, excellent. - Anyone who wants to
start a community garden give it a shot. You know, it's not necessarily
going to be an easy thing. Find a group of like-minded
people that you're going to be able to share the
responsibility with. Start talking to your local council. I find, you know, I
think that local councils are supportive and they are
very much waking up that food is a part of reacting
to the climate crisis. It's a part of building more sustainable and resilient communities. So start talking to your local council. When we started off, we
started with some letter drops in our local area. We built a very kind of simple website so people can get online
and see what you're about. The power of social media. - You're on the resources that you've got
and just start - Exactly, yeah, just give it a go. I think also connecting
with local community groups is really good. And just talk to everyone that you can. And talk to lots of
other community gardens. We have a wealth of
knowledge and experience around Adelaide. There's so many new and
old community gardens. So get out there and give it a go. (soft guitar music)",,,,

garden it's a place for aboriginal women to connect and learn from each other and the land hayley longbottom is the health and wellbeing manager at wamenda south coast women's health and welfare aboriginal corporation this is korea language which translates in english to country of trees and water this is our community garden space so i call it the farm people come in here they learn how to cook things learn about growing recipes taking that aim and then in turn you know that's feeding their families feeding their communities part of our market garden your body that we feed into um our fruit and vegetable boxes for community and social enterprise i see this uh looks like the the one last lonely sphere this is what it's all about yeah it's exactly what it's all about all the fresh stuff eh well should we save this for a box or should we share it have a little go yeah let's try terrible lovely aim can you actually see jack eichland designed the garden plant and is working to gradually bring it to life with the help of gardeners and volunteers it's a really welcoming space what's the uh premise of the design well kareel and gorda is actually designed to be a demonstration sites and setting up zones for each one of those programs to use what are some of the zones we've got the kids zone over there it's a nice safe zone for the kids to run around play so we've got a few raised beds with the fruit berries that kind of thing in there another example would be the market garden zone a lot of the different varieties of kale lettuce that does really well seasonally here we have the jabba jacaba growing at the moment got a few apple species and a lot of our produce goes straight back into our cooking business in the center here that's called our ceremonial space in there's where we come together for yarning circles and just meeting and gathering feels like the mounted beds really give it an embrace yeah it is it is it's a beautiful little space and when all these trees actually get up and are established you're going to be surrounded by this canopy of green life so it should be a really nice place to come and just be [Music] building healthy soil and recycling food organics and green waste is also a big part of the garden michelle maloney is one of the gardeners and knows all about the bush tucker plants grown here [Music] yeah we have some warragal greens you blanch the smaller leaves the bigger leaves as they grow they get very very bitter the yellow ones aren't so good either yellow ones are no good some lemon centered tea tree which will be used to stuff the fish and put on the fire the cook good for aussies too this one great smell right here we have a fingerling tree we care very very quickly last of the finger lines would be possible finger lines yeah sharp tree but great habitat great habitat and we'll use that on our fish all right let's go skye from the newly cooking alive program has offered to make us a feed with some produce from the garden [Music] this is my kind of table what are we going to do trevally with the lemon tea tree that you guys just picked and we're going to keep it very very simple so just fold and crush we're going to just pop this in like that all right and uh we have some of the smoked oil blackberry vinegar so again pretty simple flavors but a little bit a little drizz little drizzle a little drizzle shake first of all yeah we're going to get a little bit of the finger lime salt and just like so and then just a couple of these pepper berries just going to drop it into the gills they're not very hot they're more like perfumey yes here's one of the karila noora finger limes and we've just had it pulled so it's gone that nice pinky color and we'll just squeeze that caviar out bush caviar and that's going to be our trevally and we're pretty much repeating something like that with all the fish but with a different element you know the salt bush or the lemon myrtle [Music] this guy this is delightful it is so nice pretty lovely home this is really just the start or the beginning i'm predicting there are many bigger things in the future oh definitely you know being able to bring our youth out here and connecting with our elders and no matter what a woman and her family are coming in with we wrap around them and it's you know our ways of knowing being and doing and that's what it's about providing and supporting her and walking alongside her on her journey not just an organisation it's a whole community behind our women here it's fantastic to see this

Music: 'People like you' by Bill Borman (creative ...,,my name's tiff and i'm a support worker for mind australia and i run the gardening programs at sprout mine australia works with people recovering from mental health issues they have a lot of residential programs and outreach services and this is a gardening program that they have it allows people to give something a go be it growing or tending the plants or harvesting them and preparing them for food so people learn skills particularly after they've been here for a little while so we've got a cooking program here called taste which is part of the day-to-day living program and that promotes the seed to table process in the morning people come and harvest together and then we use that to cook in the kitchen and usually we do a different recipe each week that people choose the week before and then we have a joint lunch with the gardeners participants get a i guess more in tune and connect more to their food and where it comes from as well as eating more seasonal produce and hopefully improving their diets i think people come here because it's a safe environment a garden is not so enclosed and when you're in recovery from mental health you might spend a lot of time in hospitals or at home and quite isolated so being part of the wider community and being out in a in a good environment seems to benefit people a lot but it's created by the people who come here we couldn't run the garden on our own and we wouldn't be nearly as productive to the wider community if we didn't have have people participating and and helping i enjoy the company for one thing everyone here is really great just coming out working in the garden is great like learning new skills and getting satisfaction you know when you you get the soil ready and everything you look down and he's going i did that it looks really good i think i like it because everybody's equal there's not a lot of distinction in terms of when you're trying to achieve something like like digging a garden bed everybody's part of that so what i love most about working here is seeing people's growth as well and being part of that and nurturing that's really special for me it's a place where people can can focus on their wellness and and their recovery and if you can help them get back into work or make people more you know provide them with the skills to be more confident i think that's really important,,,,
n_fVs1k2b-Y,Community gardens in Northern Australia,https://youtu.be/n_fVs1k2b-Y,Laneway Community Garden | Discovery | Gardening Australia,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzzsltdnAgTMSlPOvjko_Dw,Gardening Australia,2025-01-31T07:00:36Z,Jane meets a community of gardeners and artists who have jointly transformed lifeless suburban laneways into vibrant meeting ...,,"JANE: Melbourne is famous for its
laneways, but they're not just confined to
the CBD. Just over ten kilometres away in the south eastern municipality
of Glen Eira, the locals are busy transforming
barren, disused spaces into thriving gardens and art
galleries. And it all started in this laneway
by two women. Ex-local cafe owner, Rita Santucci and nearby neighbour Kirsten
Brookes. KIRSTEN: So this is Lacey's Lane, and it's the first of the laneway
series of the Carnegie Laneways through Carnegie and Glenhuntly. It was just a derelict space
that's been beautified, and it's just turned into
this multifaceted space. RITA: It's a place of connection
and community connection. I can just walk down here
and have a chat to someone, do a bit of gardening and there's
always someone coming past walking their dogs or children
going to school. It's a meeting place, which is just
what community is all about. So who is Laz? Who was Laz?
Exactly. So Laz was one of our neighbours. And when we were developing this,
he became ill and he passed away. So I think as part of the process
of grieving, we thought it was really important
to have a memory of him. He was super kind. He helped all of the neighbours,
everything you would want in a good neighbour and part
of a community that was Laz. So how did you go about
transforming this area? Well, talking to neighbours and met
Kirsten and I said I'd like to make
it look pretty. What did you do first? I just put down some compost
and some mulch and then found some plants. And it started from there. Starting very small, we thought,
let's see how it goes. Let's invite other people who live
around to drop their plants and their propagations in. This is a no water zone and some
things have worked and some things haven't, but it has been very much
about getting people in the community to put
in a little bit of themselves into a garden that we can all
share. And tell me about the artwork,
because you're really responsible for the ceramics and all
of that sort of stuff. Yes, I'm a ceramic artist
and I make garden art. And I said, I'll make the signage
for Laz's Lane, and that's where it first started. And I've made signs for the other
laneways as well. Are you responsible for the
paintings of Alice in Wonderland or the Modigliani paintings?
Not the paintings, no. So who does that? We source big blue board sheets,
and we cut them down and prep them for members of the
public to take home. So they paint them at their leisure
and then they bring them back. Wonderful. So what do you think Laz
would make of this place now? I think les would be absolutely
delighted that his neighbours have continued his work
in being kind and friendly and welcoming to the area, and that we've enjoyed
each other's company. He was about people. He was about community. He was about kindness. And that's what this embodies. This isn't the only laneway
in the community. Just under two kilometres
away is Bird Lane. The 200 metre long, lush habitat
garden is one of seven in the area with more in development. Bird Lane is a different scenario. It's a blue stone drain. All of the properties on the side
run their storm water into it and it was just full of
rubbish, debris. Waterlogged even because the
channel didn't flow. Volunteer Tania Splawa-Neyman, with
a background in sustainable design, has thrown herself into urban
ecology. TANYA: I've sort of come into this
as a citizen scientist, really, and trying to learn about how we
can enhance habitat and make things better for our
struggling wildlife. So I've been growing indigenous
plants myself in my own home garden and also propagating a lot
of plants. So once I get them growing,
you can take the seeds, you can take cutting propagation
material. And that sort of coincided quite
nicely with getting excited about the potential of the lane
and having some plants ready to be able to come and plant here. You've got three plants
that are really important for this little area
that you're planting in. What are they?
Yeah, absolutely. So we have microlaena stipoides. A common name is weeping grass. I can see why it's weeping grass. Yeah. It's got that gorgeous seed
head on it there. So that's the one that's
often suggested as an indigenous lawn grass, which
can be mowed. But it is a fabulous plant
for invertebrates for a larval host plant. Common brown butterflies,
for example, love laying their eggs on this. And, you know, we want as much
of it as we can. Get the sun and they'll all come
in here. This is wahlenbergia, which is
the native bluebell. And that's just a gorgeous plant. Also a really important
larval host plant. Also pollinators, because we've
seen tiny little wasps actually going for the flowers on these,
which is amazing. And beautiful little blue flowers. They're gorgeous. And this one is
a lovely one. Such commonly grown but beautiful. Yeah, yeah. So the native violets. Just a gorgeous ground cover. Will do really well here
because it's very moist. It's actually a drain. So that's going to take
off isn't it. That should really take off in
these areas where the water's coming out from
people's houses. How did you find planting in
amongst the bluestone, though? That's difficult. Well, we're quite lucky here
because we have unusually, I think, for these types of lanes,
quite a large culvert, garden bed on the sides. So weeding the bluestone
has been quite challenging. A lot of drain sedge,
which is a common weed but really likes damp areas. Heaps of drain sedge in between
the cracks of the bluestone. That's a big project.
It is. How many people have you got
involved in this side of things? Most working bees, we've had
roughly 15 people. Very good. Yeah, we certainly would welcome
as many as wanted to come. It's great that people are
so interested in what you're doing, though. In a funny old lane way. It's wonderful.
Absolutely. Long time working bee volunteer
Chun Hin Ng, loves the laneway so much, he made sure his family has direct
access to it from their backyard. CHUN: We moved in a few years ago and then shortly after maybe a year
or two, we found out about this laneway. Someone actually knocked on our
door and was like, do you want to come and join us? So that was, I think, one
of the first working bees. And we were just like,
this is amazing space. Our fence was already slightly
going and we were just like, we just got to put in something
here with a gate. We have quite a small courtyard, so having access to this lets my
inner gardener come out and actually plant things into the
ground. So that's amazing. But there's also like a veggie
npatch that the kids can help grow stuff
in, and just having them exposed
to that and being able to play
in it as well. It's also all the wildlife, the
insect life that comes around, seeing the birds flit in and out. It's just really livened
up all that connection to wildlife, which you don't often get living
in small units in dense places like this. It's incredible seeing these
community led transformations of public places. They not only green an area,
but bring people together. This is about anybody in the space
being able to join in. There's no committee. There's no must be, must have. It's really very freelance. So we never know really
where it's going to end. So it's the beauty of the
environment, but very much
about the community. This goodwill and enthusiasm
has spread beyond the laneways. Not far away, John McKenna
has created a small public garden right opposite his house. It's called Reflection Garden and
it's a memorial to four Victorian police officers
who were tragically killed in a motor accident in 2020. Now, I've known John for many years and I can't wait to see
what he's been up to. The Glen Huntly Reflection Garden
is absolutely amazing. I'm loving it. First of all, it started with a
little bit of a memorial, I thought I'd put a couple of pot
plants up with some ribbons. The rest is history. It's now over 50m long. People keep coming back
and watering it and we've got
a great team of volunteers. So what's the garden all
about? Jane, for me, as a wheelchair user,
I get a lot of pleasure out of looking at plants. I don't get to put dirt under my
fingernails like you do. But you know what? It's beautiful how I can have a
shared purpose, a shared vision with other
neighbours who believe in, want a nice place
to sit and to get in and get involved. And these are the sorts
of conversations I've been having for about four
years as this has evolved, how much pleasure it gives
children, senior people, people with
disabilities, all people in the community
that don't have their own garden. And isn't that the thing
about gardening? That's what draws them all together. Two things food and gardening. It brings us all together. It's true. And how do you manage to get
so many volunteers? It's organic. It's word of mouth. People walk past and talk
and stop. We're in between a couple
of train stations. So people often say, okay, I might
have a little rest right now, you know, have something to drink. I'm often saying, hi, how are you
going? Isn't this beautiful? They all go, yep, love.
How'd it start? All right, I did, but that was
years ago. I reckon it's cause you're bossy,
that's why. You do need a little bit
of bossiness. Oh, I was only joking. No, no, no, no, no. It's about being friendly,
but assertive with regards to... That's good.
Go back to the word shared vision. Hey, neighbours. Those weeds keep coming
thanks to your support. What does this garden actually
mean to you deep down? Well, I can be selfish to say I
live close, so I get to see it every day. And it is about me being able
to escape those nasty computers, the screens to smell and watch
and hear the sounds. Because yes, it's on a train line,
but there are plenty of times where it's very quiet. It's in the heart of Melbourne,
but it still sends out calming relaxation, reflection energy,
which I love. Well, I do congratulate
you because from 1 or 2 pots it's developed into quite something. It certainly has and it is quite
a space where people could relax. Hence the word, Reflection Garden. From railway gardens to laneways,
these once unloved public spaces have had new life breathed into
them, all thanks to passionate community
volunteers.",,,,

Subscribe: ...,,[Music] i'm catching up with an old friend and colleague brendan moore who's helping run a fabulous community garden producing a lot of fruits brendan and i used to work together at the royal botanic gardens in sydney and it's so great to see where his gardening journey has taken him it looks like a very productive garden but it's not just about the plants is it we're growing produce and that's healthy produce to go out to our communities but also this garden is for community to come in socialise but also learn more about gardening chris jeweler has been volunteering here for the last decade g'day chris hey clarence how are you buddy good to see you again what does this place mean to you i go to the garden because it's therapy to me and we've had people come in after a bad weekend they've been down in the dumps when they leave in the afternoon i see that smile on those people's faces and i go there's your therapy they've come down worked a little bit in the garden harvest a bit of fruit if we got it and to me that's heroic seeing smiling faces i enjoy helping people out i enjoy doing gardens it's just you can't go wrong what are some of the things you're growing here at the moment well at the moment we've got a big variety of tomatoes there's a hundred tomato plants in but they're all different varieties we've got lebanese cucumbers silver beet different coloured silver beak we actually got the proper english spinach over there corn baby squashes in the middle there we've got strawberries growing over there we've got snow peas growing it brings us all together we're like a family it's just like brendan when he comes from botanical gardens he feels welcome here we make everyone feel welcome you don't have to do any work in the garden but we all have a yarn we help each other out and that's the whole idea of it friendship the garden is at the heart of the thorough aboriginal corporation which offers a huge range of medical and social services dietitian sophia mallier runs one of the most popular and successful programs here so what are we looking at here today so um so this is our good tucker program we usually get produce from the local fruit market and from our garden which we then pack up in individual boxes and deliver to the community this is our group of volunteers who meet up every week and help with the packing process today we've got 36 boxes being delivered but it can average between 30 to 50 60 boxes depending on the weeds and then we all load it back up on the truck and drop it off to people's houses it's been received very highly we've taken parcels to the elders doors and some of them get tears in their eyes saying you brought them to me well yeah you're an elder you can't get to the shop all the time and it makes them feel wanted and it makes us feel needed because we're helping them out and that's what attracts me to this place you're helping out all the time what does the program teach people about food and diet it's about eating your five serves of vegetables and your two serves of fruit today it's hard for some clients to get to the shops or even carry the produce back to their home without a car without you know using public transport that kind of thing this is about taking all those barriers off and just dropping the produce to their house so they can literally just use it up it also teaches about variety it gets them to try different things we usually put a recipe as well in the boxes so just giving people some ideas things that they haven't made before what are some of the uses how to store them and get the most of what we've put in the boxes who gets the food boxes we target families but anyone from an aboriginal or torres strait islander descent living in southwest sydney pretty much can order them is it a free service um the boxes are 20 but we're cost neutral and we literally spend the 20 on food so that costs neutral but a very big social benefit yeah definitely i've noticed we've got a few uh punnets of veggies there and i've brought a few things along uh should we get into a bit of planting let's go for it thanks chris and the team have some veggie seedlings ready to be planted and i brought some myrna or yam daisy one of the coolest things about this plant is part of our aboriginal heritage and we're able to bring them back they're such a staple and they're so good to eat they'll all make great additions to the good tucker program boxes so what's the future hole for this space so we've got a cafe going over there we're going to have a running stream we're also putting a mini rain forest in and a couple of yarn in circles and this garden is going to be extended right over to the side there we'll double in our garden area so it's going to be a pretty big awesome job when it's finished so community garden cultural space yes social gatherings all the that is correct yes and anyone's welcome well it's clear this garden is a source of genuine community pride and a place where strong lifelong bonds are forged [Music] you,,,,

this video I take you on a tour of the Maralinga Community Garden in Keysborough, Melbourne, Australia, and answer all the ...",,foreign I've got a treat for you today we are at the maralinga community gardens in Melbourne Southeast and I'm going to give you a tour of this epic community garden I'm also going to answer all of your questions about Community Gardens what does that even mean who can get involved does it cost anything to get to enjoy and eat the food that you grow if you haven't already hit the Subscribe button that means you won't miss one of our garden tours they happen at least every month and this is why I feel like the mother of the garden [Music] welcome to maralinga community garden which is in Chandler Reserve in keysborough somebody said to me it'll get in your blood and you won't want to leave and I went well it's in my blood and um because I've seen it it's like having a baby watching it grow and I'm going to give you let's try a piece of Apple from our Orchard homegrown a short country the garden is the brainchild of Brian Hunter the Environmental Studies teacher had already set up an incredible urban farm at Athol Road primary school and seen onceptions growing enough to supply the school and their local community all year round my prices aren't going up they're still it's usually a dollar so a dollar for a bunch of silver beads after seeing the joy and health benefits it brought to students he decided to introduce Community gardening to keysborough when we started this process in 2019 I thought this is an amazing idea for a space on Community Land that could benefit the community members but the process going through code and everything else so I was ready to throw in the towel so to speak um but coming out the other side now in 2023 I couldn't be happier I think this is the most amazing idea for this location to be able to give back to the community in a way where we want them to come in and share what we can do here it's been a year and a half since this Garden was first set up and it's taken some time to get going but it is now absolutely thriving 44 of these bio filter Beds which are producing a huge amount of food so let's have a look at what we can pull out of the bed this would probably be termed a baby beat but look how beautiful it looks so what what actually is a community garden and how does it work if people don't have like a front yard and backyard um to grow in they can come and hire one of these uh for three months six months or a year and grow their produce well these two rows here were because we had so many seedlings donated we've made these our community type beds where we're growing produce the ones in that front row are largely hired out by individual families and some of them have a bio filter bed and a raised bed as well the prices here have just come down it's a hundred dollars to hire one of the biofilter food Cube beds for a year but people can choose shorter time frames or different styles of beds whatever they grow is Theirs to take home whatever we grow in the community garden we've got options of what we do we're growing zucchinis and they'd start off this big one week and because the was so wet they would be this big the week after Italians would tell me their their marrows we've got three or four Charities around here who do community meals and so I was able to um give it to them to cook meals to feed people it's really wonderful because you do come together with like-minded people and learn as you go and you know just seeing the beautiful produce this is a keyed Community only because people are paying for their beds we can't have it open because you know if they're paying for it and then they come and they've lost some of their crop they're going to be disappointed and it's low food miles as well and not only that what I realized was not going and buying it from a supermarket and you've got to get rid of the packaging food security is a big thing so to be able to grow your own fresh produce for a very small cost I think is an amazing experience and to learn from others as well being on the land here I am learning so much and I'm really pleased that we never stop learning I'm no expert in gardening in my own sense but people that come here will teach me something and I'm hoping to be able to teach others tell me about these garden beds how many have you gotten where did they come from so these are bio filter wicking beds so in the bottom they hold 110 liters each but each row is connected so if these are individual you can put the hose in there and um it fills up and at the end of each of the rows there's like an overflow thing so if we want to walk with me and I can show you here is an overflow oh yeah so the water's coming out now that that shows us that it's got water in it and then we just pull it up it is very a very clever so let's say I water here and another bed up the top is um low on water the water levels itself Chrissy you can see the little tunnel things that connect them and we've been fortunate that when we've set these out and join the mum we got rain and so we really haven't had to turn the hose on you can see the white piping these can have a net over them where you can see that we've had the Nets delivered in that our last delivery and so these can become a hot house they can protect the veggies against white moth they are a locally produced wicking bed from Carrom Downs they're made out of recycled foil and and plastic so if a large manufacturer there's a print mistake instead of throwing it away they make these they've got a platform in them that encourages the wicking and this soil is bio grow and it's a special combination that is free draining but also allows the wicking the bio grow mixture is just right for everything anything any crop at the end of the day as it goes over into our compost bins and brown Ryan our president chips it with the motomoa because we don't have electricity here and that will turn into compost and come back so every bed will have a trellis so people for the price that they pay get a trellis the cubic meter and all the soils provided to them so these are the new screens that we'll put up probably tomorrow when we're all here oh this is a native Violet so this is my indigenous bed here there's also a row of fruit trees in the orchard while still very young they are already starting to produce look at the lemon on the lemon tree there's mulberries on the Mulberry Tree do you want to take a photo of the mulberries on the mulberry tree I love them here we've got a pineapple guava that is just amazing and I'm going to pick when the fruit goes yellow pineapple guava I've never heard of that oh you don't have to try one Christy can I yes of course you can so you'd eat the skin of that absolutely I would just take a huge bite and it's going to be beautiful all right let me give you another little yep jeans boom isn't that delicious oh wow oh amazing yeah it's just one of those you know Delicacies that you might not have it in your own home and in a community garden if they're going to need to get one of those trees well this is it you you can get to try things here and then think yes do I want it or not you know what I mean like do I want my own and it's a bit like the mulberries until I tasted the last season I didn't realize how good they were what's your favorite thing to grow what brings you the most Joy the coriander actually um the strawberries are amazing coming out of these they're just big and Lush seeing the carrots form actually seeing the the children come and pick their own carrots these sort of thing very cheap to pull together how did where'd you get that am I actually in my head and it surprised me um did the figures of what has been invested in this 500 square meters in the last 18 months and I'm going to tell you I was staggered over 80 000 has just been invested in the last 18 months which I find staggering I had no idea until I edited it up myself we've been fortunate enough to get three grants for this um Garden the first one was from Council which allowed us to build the fence and connect the water and get our signs we really need to thank some some big organizations but also other community groups that helped us along the way we've had for instance Noel park is there a Lions Club that made a nice donation to our community garden that was able to put in some infrastructure dingley Noble Park Rotary Club have also given a very generous donation and that money actually helped us get over the line to secure our largest Grant and that helped put our shed up the living local Grant which is through the state government Southeast water was our first grant that allowed us to establish some of our biofilter food cubes on site and also our local Bunnings our keysborough Bunnings store have been amazing especially in that first 12 months they were able to come along and help build certain garden beds and supplies with the shed and fruit trees and all sorts of bits and pieces I'd like to thank catch who was the activities organizer at the time during that time for keysborough Bunnings without all those contributions we wouldn't be where we are today definitely to have extra help when we're quite small we've got about 25 members has been really helpful to get us up running and being productive as we do a walk we will see our raised beds that Bunnings actually came and helped build and construct along with some school students I know the the first bit of fundraising that we did it was actually from someone's abundance of limes and feijoas in 18 months we've come a very long way from even what I expected starting out back in 2019 hopefully what we can offer now at this community space will encourage other local members to come and get involved so very happy with what achieves if you live anywhere near Melbourne Southeast we're in keysborough anyone can come and get involved just find the maralinga community garden Facebook group and send them a message if you've got a community garden in your area please go and support it please go and have a look at it because they've done all the hard work you just have to come in and play it you just have to grow and you've got the community around you I'm on the hunt for some of the best gardens around Melbourne so if you know of another great Garden that we should be featuring please send me an email I'll put it here I'll also put it in the description if you're interested in supporting the channel at all they ask you to do is go and check out my playlist find something else and keep watching [Music],,,,

collector's colourful ...,,"[Music] hey [Music] budy hello and welcome to gardening Australia for many of us it's the start of autumn others the wet season keeps on keeping on wherever you are we're keeping the gardening Good Times Rolling here's what we've got in store for you this week Tammy's heading up to see what goodness is growing on a newly established balcony Garden the inspiring thing about this Garden of Steves is just how much there is of it they say that love is the universal language understood by all that I've found a place place where the love of gardening is the universal language and it's B many cultures of the world together this has to be one of the very best times of year in the garden it's so abundant but it's also the perfect time to get some work done for your future Awards and when we think of autumn the Temptation is to imagine the Reds and Golds of Maples and other Northern Hemisphere trees but I'm going to show you some native plants that have plenty of autumnal [Music] color the great thing about being a plant person is that it stays with you forever no matter where you go the passion for growing remains and even if you move to a smaller place it doesn't mean you have to lower your expectations as Tammy is finding out [Music] there's something thrilling about moving house and building a brand new Garden but what about rebuilding a brilliant established Garden in a brand new space I've known Steve Fon for years he's a horticulturist who writes about Gardens Steve this is looking super Lush hey thanks Tammy it's not too bad not too bad so you've got a few veggies and flowers in here exactly yeah but mostly veggies it's just the odd flower here there cuz I can't help myself but at home definitely a lot more flowers and less veggies oh I think we should go see that absolutely let's do it in 2019 we visited Steve's previous Garden an extraordinary rooftop Urban Oasis made up of hundreds and hundreds of Po wonders since then Steve has had to move his rooftop gun to a much smaller space but how to squeeze it all [Music] in WoW Steve yeah it's pretty um pretty amazing oh thank you yeah it's highly concentrated color form and texture a portrait in miniature of an urban Garden romance there's so much going on there's color flowers and even trees and fruit yeah that's what makes it good I've tried as much as I can to jam as much as possible into what is a pretty small space and how small is it uh 6 M by 4 M so 24 Square all up probably lost maybe half the space so that meant plants had to go what was that experience like that was really hard like really really hard it's like you know saying goodbye to your babies um yeah it it was hard even now I'm like but once once we did the C uh then then it's just getting used to being in a different location so different light levels is this is a lot sunnier but also quite windy and which means it's a lot harder on the plants so does it mean your plant collection has sort of compromised as a result look a few things didn't really make the transition they had to go bit of a learning curve for sure so Steve you've created a real sense of depth here I can see you've built up layers but what have you used to do that um so all around the edges are rectangular troughs and there's two layers of them so the layer at the back is slightly higher so that helps give a little bit of height but also kind of depth to look into a bed just gives it a little but it's hidden so well with the plants like I can't make out that there's troughs under there yeah well I don't like to see the edges cuz it kind of ruins the illusion but also because this does cop the hot afternoon sun it is Handy for helping to insulate the pot so the roots stay a little bit cooler the plants don't dry out quite as fast all that is that why you've then planted so densely as well I mean for visual effect but also to help the plants sort of you know stand up on their own look I think it does make a big difference yeah the extra moisture in the air you know the the humidity that they create upon each other helps I think when we get that hot weather that comes through obviously visually it works really well and I like it but the plants have kind of each other for company you know they've got got their companions to keep them company and keep them well looked after kind of all works together Steve's balcony is so deep it takes a little courage and Agility to get all the way into the furthest beds so what's really thrived here there's kind of a few groups of plants the tanas or the airplants uh they're very very happy Brads kind of my stars really really happy in the space and one of the great thing about them is small root balls so I can fit a lot of them in amongst other plants and they're not fighting for space in the pots then there's some succulents tucked in here and there good old succulents also quite a few bulbs there's something magical about bulbs and many of them are happy in Potts great so you know I can have bulbs but mostly it's accepting this is what will grow well here and I'd rather have thriving plants than sort of sad things uh also I am an organic Gardener so I do focus on trying to make sure that the soil is as good as it can possibly be to keep the plants strong kind of from the base all the way up makes a big difference I think Steve also has a smaller balcony facing south where plants can get a reprieve if it's all too much and how old is your garden it's only 2 years since I've moved in but I definitely feel like the garden now is feeling established I want my garden to be interesting like it it needs to have changed for me um if a garden is static it's kind of boring like I want things happening all the time it has a really nice feel to it quite happy with the way it's all come together feels like a real Garden renewal isn't necessarily easy but the evidence of Steve's commitment to his garden is all around us so Steve you've done it you've gone from a large rooftop to this sweet balcony how does it make you feel it feels good actually yeah I it was a difficult decision to make to to downsize so to speak uh and I wasn't sure I'd be able to cope with having less plants I know I know we're still going through therapy for that but it's come together really well uh I'm glad I I made the move and I'm happy with the garden it's good well the garden certainly looks happy yeah yeah they're thriving Steve's balcony is a brilliant reminder of how a passion for plants can pull you through challenging times it's a partnership that helps Steve and his garden make it through to the other side refreshed and at peace the inspiring thing about this Garden of Steves is just how much there is of it and I hope it becomes a motivation for anyone with just a few pots on their back balcony to see that as just the [Music] start here you go thank you thank you thanks for coming to see my garden what a lovely view yes it's beautiful isn't [Music] it is there a way to improve the flavor of dandelion well many years ago when I was as a kid in London I maintained a plot of very fine dandelions and just as they started to produce new leaves in Spring what I'd do was to get a terracotta pot and place it over a clump now that blanches the leaves and they grow up towards the sunlight in the hole that removes all the bitterness but they remain lovely and crisp now if you combine that with a lime based salad dressing and a little bit of toasted sesame The Humble dandelion becomes a gourmet meal what makes heirloom seeds so special heirloom varieties have been growing for Generations making them part of our agricultural Heritage there are literally thousands of varieties of Heritage vegetables growing all over the world and they display unique characteristics which make them well suited to various conditions such as heat tolerance or disease resistance the other thing is that heirloom varieties are true to type meaning you can save seed from a crop and have it display the same traits The Following Season why do we cut leaves in half on cuting or seedlings well leaves are so important for photosynthesis turning sunlight into plant energy and food but they also release heaps of moisture through transpiration without roots cuting struggle to replace the water lost through big leaves that's needed to put more energy into building a new root system by removing 99% of the leaves and cutting the remaining large one in half you can actually balance the plant's resources better between root and choot meaning the plant can retain more water so it can develop into a whole new [Music] plant poet's Corner in Sydney's red fern is a Cosmopolitan place it's a real Melting Pot of people from all over the world who've come together to share a love of gardening Paula Lee is originally from Vietnam and these Community Gardens have been a big part of her life for over 10 years hello Paula hey morning name Costa how great to meet you I've bought you a little gift of Greek biscuits oh it's very nice thank you wow look at the Garden there's so much going on how many plots are there um 16 16 and they're so full please come in thank [Music] you we are people in um 70 and 80 years old the community garden is nestled between two residential blocks where the gardeners live what is it that you love about this Garden I think um the because most of us living in um highrise building we don't have a balcony in the afternoon you just take a short walk and do some light work in the garden I get to know um people in my neighborhood more and what are the people in the neighborhood all about they are from different backgrounds we have Chinese croatians Malaysian Korean Greek Filipino Vietnamese Czech and Russian wow it's a real United Nations I know I think people have uh different idea about how to take care of their own plot uh some people want to grow veggies only Some people prefer flower so this is your plot Paula yes who's been helping you learn about gardening I must say that the people from botanic garden from the community Greening project we learned a lot how to uh grow the plants from seeds and from seedlings and how to prepare the soil um and when is the time to buy some fertilizer and add it to um the garden and how to look after the plants as well flowers or plants have special meaning to me for example this one called Curly soup yeah curly soup given to me by my friends oh nice and this one the Chinese lantern given uh to me by my neighbor and this some chili and look at this one this is the Vietnamese mint Vietnamese mint yes yeah we use a to garnish our food what do you love about having a plot like this it's I I think having a garden similar to having a pet but maybe it's less time consuming that's a good [Music] point yeah I uh heard that you're from Czech Republic that's right I lived there for quite some time oh am am so I I had the chance to pick up some of your language but uh here your garden is speaking my language tell me what are you growing in your patch well lots of things I've been focusing on herbs and it helps for teas and salads and just expect experimenting these few things like some ecological mix to bring more butterflies and little insects then big sunflowers so what have you got growing I see you've got some time time I have a sage and basil then there is some lemon B parsley what brought you to Australia why did you leave Czech Republic well it was a bit of ADV Venture really um I came just with my sister and at that time they were recruiting migrants from Europe young people and we migrated in 1969 to Australia yeah and just wanted to see the world and that was the only way I think to do that at that time from Czech Republic what does it mean to you coming down into a garden space like this no it's a really wonderful opportunity to come down from my flat in the high rise and even on rainy days you know just to come and just be in the safe space sit down under the shade of a tree and just contemplate and just actually rest my eyes on nature on Greenery on flowers so it's a real blessing you know to be part of nice community of people they a few regulars like Nina and Paula and so I get to know them yeah would you like to your coffee Nina a biscuit this is shortbread this is Sesame and this is orange and oh Sesame yeah AI these are Greek biscuits my contribution to to the Multicultural Gathering thank you some of Paula and Diana's gardening friends turn up to share tea and biscuits another universal language of community life in the garden so Nina how do you say thank you sp Philippines Sal Salat how do you say thank you in Vietnamese yes correct in Croatia and what about in Czech oh I know that one yeah and then in great but it's soon back to work with Paula and Danna who want some help with a neglected part of their community [Music] garden there is something it's like the brick or something yeah the garden is were frustrated because this area was kind of one of those spots like most of us having the garden it's Shady there's kind of stuff growing there we're not that happy with it how long has this space been kind of a noo Zone I guess it's for years because we thought that this one is not good for any plants to grow because it's not enough Sun yeah so we've got creeping booby all which is a really rampant ground cover which is what you want in a space like this behind that of course the duty of ferns they love this sort of dappled light condition and that'll start to create a little bit of a next te here up a little bit of height and then we've got the apple berry and it wants to climb so it'll climb over this fence and kind of Disguise the car park and then the last one we've got over the back is alpia a native [Music] Ginger when these spread out over the area can you imagine how many white flowers there's going to be wow oh yeah that that'll be great that's what we really need here few flowers yeah cuz that's going to bring the insects yeah W and you know and that will help with the pollination of all the food plants as well okay which is really good that's perfect so we need to accommodate them exactly so we need some bee hotels yeah I reckon you could put some in and around off the fence up the trees there lots of opportunities you you'll have to think about it poet's corner has shown me that the love of gardening truly can be our universal language accessible to everyone it's given this vibrant Inner City Community a place to grow and share now that's life in my books I me this one's looking good isn't it oh yeah [Music] that's it's been a great year for the pumpkins but boy do they take some water yet just over here I've got a plant that's in a baking full Sunspot ordinary soil and it's had absolutely no water it's Saria californica it comes from California it loves this dry baking heat you can see it's got gray furry foliage and it's been an absolute Delight for many many months over Summer and Autumn the other thing that loves it is the little honey eating birds so a great addition to a hot dry Sunny [Music] Garden many parts of the country are headed Full Steam into Autumn and it's a chance to really shift years in the garden cool climate Millie knows this better than most and she's here with a plan for the change of [Music] season this truly has to be one of the most gorgeous moments in any Garden I reckon lots of you would have with me you've got beautiful still warm days warm soil and a hint of the cooler weather to come which means it is the perfect time to get so many things [Music] done one thing I can be really guilty of in the garden is getting so focused on all those jobs I have to do that I fail to stop and really look at What's happen happening and assess it for the season [Music] ahead these daras are a great example of that last year I grew them all from random seedlings I didn't know what color they were going to be and then when they went dormant in Winter I lifted them I stored them diligently but I didn't keep track of what they were so when I put them back in the garden last spring I couldn't really work out where what color should go or even some of the small varieties to put them in the right position in the bed so this year I want to mark them before they go dormant now you can see here there's two quite distinctly different yellows on this one plant now I'm not sure if it's one plant throwing different colors or a couple of different tubers that have ended up being planted together but I'm going to mark them with some Christmas ribbon and so when they die back and go dormant I'll be able to keep track inspect and next year I can be even more diligent with my displays [Music] another really important job I do a lot of at this time of the year is saving seed that means that I'm selecting the very best performing flowers and food plants out of the garden to ensure next season they're even better this is a lettuce variety it's a red leaf CA that was given to me from my Big Brother's Garden which is about 32,000 km west of here it was already a great lettuce which is why I asked for some seed but the benefit of growing and saving it year after year here in my garden is it's just becoming even better it is a climatizing to the conditions here so now it's going from a really good plant to superfood and lettuce is truly one of the simplest things you can save yourself at home it is a lovely little Daisy you can see the flower there and then once these fluffy little seed heads start to form you can cut it you can just cut entire bunches off like that and then put them in a saucer or a basket to dry and over the next week or two you'll find a lot of that seed will actually release and you can clean it and store it for sewing next [Music] year this corn flour is probably the bluest in the garden this year so I wanted save some seed and you can see that these little dry flower heads are absolutely packed they're quite unique looking little seed they've got Tails almost look like little paint brushes so I'm just going to take some of those heads off and then leave them to dry for a week or two and then I can get the seed out put it in a jar keep it safe for sewing again next [Music] spring you might remember when I set these carrots up to save some seed it was a a great variety and it held in the ground fantastically through winter so you can see that it's got some nice Bunches of seed which are essentially dry so I reckon there's enough for me to save here the technique is pretty simple I'll hang the whole plant in the shed carrot and all and let it dry for a couple of weeks before I can clean and store the [Music] seed in a regular sized Garden it's hard to ever let any space go to waste and particularly as we dive into those cooler months once it's cold here growth stops you can't establish new food so I've already got most of this bed planted with brassers and where that carrot was sitting that's valuable real estate so straight away I'm going to follow up with another crop to prepare the bed I just Fork it over layer on some compost and then Fork again before soaking it really well I always check my brassa seedlings for caterpillar eggs before I plant them at this time of the year I just use a really thin layer of mulch and then water again before the net goes on to protect [Music] them another really simple technique for making the most of space particularly at this time of year is to raise a lot of seedlings that means as soon as a bit of space opens up in the garden you've got mature plants ready to go in now I do it with the obvious things but I also do it with some unusual crops things like root crops turnips and Beach root it's untraditional method it's not normal that you would do that but it works really well so what I do is sew the seed and as they germinate I thin to about three plants per cell when there's a spot in the garden that whole clump of three plants can go in the ground and you get even more bang for your [Music] back if you've only got space in your life for one job at the moment I reckon it should be making compost it is the fuel for every great Garden you can do it almost anywhere I've got a couple of systems one where I just Chuck kitchen scraps in all the time it breaks down slowly it's a bit like a worm farm and then this which is designed for bulk materials I can put a cubic meter of manure or other things in here and they can break down but right now I want to make a really good compost brew and there's a couple of rules for doing that no matter what your system one is diversity you want lots of different materials you want leafy green things like this Garden waste you want Brown things like leaves and you can even add animal manures that's one my chicken poo that's going to go into it adds a lot of nitrogen the other thing you need to do is you need to chop things up small it gives all of those organisms a chance to actually break that material down it's like you know chewing them first for them and I've done that with secretar I've bashed things with hammers I've chopped things with knives but recently I've decided that I want to upscale my compost game you can hire petrol mulches but I really want an electric one and after a long search I found this one secondhand [Music] you can see that that material is absolutely pulverized and mixed up I've been putting both dry and green through it so it's a great basis for the compost I'm going to sprinkle on a bit of that CH manure Chuck in some leaves and then I'll give it all a bit of a stir the magic ingredient for compost is Water by keeping that moist it'll really activate all of those microorganisms that do the work and that thermometer within a couple of days will be up at 60° which is what I want in a couple of weeks when it cools down I'll turn it again maybe add some more water and off it goes and in a few months I'll have really high quality compost to put out on the garden anytime in the garden really is so amazing but this time of the year is so deeply satisfying so make sure this weekend you take a moment to look at how far you've come taste a little of this delicious season and of course get some work [Music] done still to come on gardening Australia Clarence checks out some local color Josh gets stuck into some salvas and we meet an incredible floral artist many things can damage plants the heat the cold animals even us gardeners you need to work out what has caused that because prevention is better than anything this Vietnamese hot mint did get burnt over summer you can see those brown leaves crinkly and if I had cut that back at that stage it would have shot again because pruning does encourage new growth and that new growth then easily could have got sunburnt again the best thing is to leave it until the change of season cut it right back you can see nice new shoots right down the bottom and that's what you need to encourage just to get rid of this sort of sunburn burty look give it a little bit of liquid fertilizer don't overfeed it just be gentle and you'll find that that plant will come back no problem at [Music] all what about family gardening Traditions have you got any favorites Jerry yes yeah I come from four generations of fruit farmers in England and one of the first things I ever did was to pick and preserve fruit wow how about you CA uh no brainer any Greek household has to be designed around the lemon tree there needs to be a lemon tree on the grounds somewhere if not one at least three yeah exactly what about you the tradition in our household was just playing out in the garden my mom would never be in to cook a meal till late at night cuz she was too busy in the garden and unfortunately I've taken that [Music] on I wonder how many of you would think of Aussie natives if I asked you to picture Autumn color in your garden not convinced Well Clarence is here to change your mind Autumn is a welcome relief from the harsh conditions of Summer and it's also a time of incredible color now while many of you might think of Maples and other Northern Hemisphere trees during this season they're not the only ones that shine now with the cooler weather and increased rainfall many Australian plants switch over from their summer survival mode now far from being a time of slowing down and dorcy they start putting on New Growth and flowers Autumn is the time to turn it up especially here at the Royal Botanic Garden cranor you really can't go past the iconic gilas and bankas with many of them putting on their best show over Autumn and with literally hundreds of cultivars available you're bound to find one suitable for your home garden now this bangia yellow Wing which is a cultivar of bangia spinulosa is particularly stunning the fine folage is completely Laden with these tight upright beautifully colored candl light flower spikes which are favorite for a range of Honey eating birds and parrots who love their [Music] seed now originally from much of the Southern Eastern Seaboard it has been bred to have a neat compact form reaching about 2 m high and 2 m wide just prune it right after flowering to keep it tight now it's also reasonably fast growing and should do well everywhere from cool to subtropical climates in full sun or part shade the other Autumn flowering favorite is this gorgeous gravila Bush lemons now it's one of the few truly yellow graia cultivars out there and these bright yellow flower spikes held against the gray green foliage really help it stand out it's also fast growing and it reach about 3 m tall and 3 m wide once it's finished flowering you can give it a light prune and feeding it some native fertilizer in Spring will certainly keep it rocketing along several Australian rainforest trees produce attractive Autumn berries and this aent Cara rolia also known as The Diamond Le poosum because of its distinctive diamond shaped leaves has heavily perfume small white flowers in summer but they are followed by the main event in Autumn these colorful orange berries that are held on the tree in clumps for several months because this species hails from Southern Queensland Northern New South Wales it suits temperate subtropical and tropical climates where it forms an attractive mediumsized tree which isn't too large for Suburban Gardens now one other thing although it looks like it this is not the weedy poosum [Music] angelum thinking laterally goes along long way when you're planting for Autumn color in the garden now this anger costada or or smooth barked apple is a large tree that grows up to 20 m in height it's from Coastal New South Wales and Inland Southern Queensland and it's popular both in large Gardens and as a street tree because of its winding Limbs and masses of white puffy flowers over summer but what makes this tree a showstopper is its beautifully colored bark now it sheds in Spring and as that happens the bark changes from this pale gray color into this beautiful ready pink salmon color and it's a dramatic feature of any Autumn Garden native or [Music] not on a smaller scale but still making an impact are the zero chome otherwise known as paper daisies now these are a beautiful plant for flower displays and can make a real statement it flowers for most of the year in a profusion of colors from Pure white yellow Shades pinks oranges and reds the first and strongest flush of blooms are in Spring but they hold on to their flowers well into Autumn they're quick growing and depending on the climate and the cultivar can be an annual a biannual or a shortlived perennial now when planting they do like a well- drained soil but they also like it in a pot now they're partial to a little bit of tip pruning but please don't overdo [Music] it then there are plants that choose Autumn to set their seeds after being fertilized in the warmer months now some of these seeds are just as big showy and intricate as many flowers when planted on mass they can make for a glowing field of color Fe triandra or kangaroo grass is a great example and this highly adaptable Grass Grows All Over Australia from full sun to part shade from Sandy to clay soils and once it's established needs very little water it goes through various colors starting off as green and as the weather cools this ornamental native grass will start to put on bronze foliage and produce large seed heads at the top of the plant because of its large distribution growing conditions for themer can be quite variable so it's best to Source seeds or Nursery stock native to your local area now as a plant it doesn't need a lot of Maintenance Dead Leaves Can Be raked out and old seed heads removed from the base now if you want to keep it looking neat and fresh the clumps can be cut back in early spring to encourage new green growth so don't be fooled into thinking that seasonal displays are the sole territory of northern hemisphere plants there's a stack of Australian ainal color to take advantage of and to keep the interest burning in your garden even as the temperatures drop I've got a really handy tool for sifting and sorting compost because while lumpy compost is absolutely great and easily spread under plants like trees for other things like adding compost to potting mix or a seed bed you need a finer grade so I've made a compost SI out of Old Timber and some Avery mesh I've made it nice and large to fit my wheelbarrow and I use Avery mesh cuz it's tough and has tiny squares which captures most of the chunky stuff I just dump the compost on and massage it through with my hands and all this chunky stuff is just going to head straight back to the compost bin where it'll keep breaking [Music] down and now all this beautiful sifted compost can go straight onto my seed [Music] bed [Music] salvas tick a lot of boxes they propagate easily they grow with minimal fuss and they develop into beautiful Hardy shrubs they're also extremely versatile their hardiness often extends to their pruning needs as well with many of the varieties preferring a hard cutback in late Autumn or into winter but how you cut them back does depend on the type for example this one which is salvia lantha or Mexican Sage puts on its strongest regrowth right from the base so pruning is kind of like setting the Clippers to zero and going the full Buzz Cup right to the very [Music] [Applause] [Music] base I know it looks drastic but don't panic I promise it will come back I pruned this Salve caner the same way just 2 weeks ago and have a look at how quickly it's coming back Salvia micro filler is a slightly different proposition this one prefers a more restrained cut evenly across the top back and sides and that's because it produces the strongest shoots off its Woody [Music] stems this just needs a quick tidy up with secars and a comb through to remove leaves and twigs again it will grow back quickly just like this one also pruned 2 weeks ago well that's the job done and I know it's left a bit of a gap but as you've seen they'll soon recover [Music] our Gardens give us so much Beauty Joy relaxation and when we're going through adversity they provide us with rest bite comfort and inspiration our next story is with a floral artist who's found all this and more on her garden Journey [Music] Gardens have always been like a huge part of my life it's what I feel like I've just been drawn to like I don't necessarily think there's like some like thing that I can put my finger on but it's just where I feel most myself gets me out of my head it gets me out of like the stresses of life I'm hiding ay and I'm a floral artist I think a floral artist goes beyond I guess like the typical floristry um that we've we've seen like lots of fruits lots of vegetables so it's not I guess also just limited to flowers when you start to push the boundaries I think if you're like starting to do like larger scale like installations with materials also that maybe aren't Just Flowers I think that's when it starts to kind of push that barrier for me at least these are some amazing garden roses that a friend luckily enough let me cut from her Bush and then I've also just paired them with some birds of paradise which people wouldn't maybe think that roses and birds and Paradise go together but it's about more so like the movement and the shape that you create biggest challenge is making sure that it's balanced um and that it stays upright as well because you do have quite a lot of weight and you've got things that are very prickly so to maneuver them and to get it all kind of right and harmonious is a [Music] skitt I was born in Black Rock and I grew up around that area and then we moved down the morning to Peninsula when I was quite Young when I would go to these like Cliff top walks down in porty and when it was freeer season and all I would do was pick bouquet upon bouquet upon bouquet of fre like posies of frees it's just all I wanted to do and spending a lot of time in my grandma's Garden like I would make posies for my teachers I would take them to school like I was just it's just what I wanted to be around my grandma would also take me to the local florist and I would sit there in awe and be like oh my God people get to do this for a job you know so I think um it was like always like what I kind of thought I would do I was working for other florists and then I was just kind of doing my own thing on the side and posting on Instagram and it was not necessarily to start a business I was actually very scared to start a business but I guess because I was doing something new that wasn't really around people kind of found my work and gravitated towards it then all of a sudden took off really quickly I was diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder in July 2021 and so so just happened all of a sudden one day I had a migraine and then the next day I was unable to walk talk and I was just convulsing and so I lost all of my ability to send like those automatic signals from my brain to my body to be able to do everything that I used to do so I've had a long road of learning how to walk again how to talk again how to do a lot of life skills again and I'm still trying to figure out how to I guess do that so fnd is pretty unknown condition as well and I feel like it's quite a stigmatized condition it does affect greatly women like 80% now studies are saying and it's something that they don't understand unfortunately it's had a huge impact on my life and my work and I mean everything I don't have Independence in this sense that I can't leave my house without someone I can't do most of my household tasks or things like that I can't drive I I use a walking stick when I'm walking or for longer periods I'm in a wheelchair this is my little balcony Garden here in East Melbourne that I like to grow as many things on it as possible I have a lot of things especially because I don't have access to going to the flower market a lot and things like that I try and grow things that I can snip and then I can make little arrangements with I feel really grounded and I guess just immersed when I'm in this space um especially when sometimes I can't get out of the house and I can't you know go out at least I get to connect with nature here and feel like I'm a part of the outside world so it's really important for me and that's why I think I've kind of made it quite immersive so it kind of hugs you almost I guess I'm growing generally for things that I can use that I use in my arrangements some sweet peas growing I've also been able to grow a stirt desert pea out here that flowered which was my greatest gardening achievement to date and then I also I guess I grow herbs and things like that as well that I like to have the cooking and things like that so everything has a practical [Music] use it always kind of amazes me what I can come up with out of that space and usually it is kind of like some quite common things like pansies violets asum so they're all really easy to grow some of these delicate flowers like you can't buy at the flower market because they are so small and dainty when I start off an arrangement I usually try and think about kind of the movement of it so I guess like it's highest point and then the I call them just like the Dy bits and I guess where also like the negative space is going to kind of lie and then a focal point which is always important and just always a bit of Interest I feel like with color I just tend to make whatever works and somehow it comes [Music] [Laughter] [Music] together [Music] it'll be nice when the Japanese maple comes my darling mother LS I feel so lucky one that we get along so well because she's been my full-time carer for the past 2 and 1/2 years and she does everything for me she's here 9:00 in the morning to 9:00 at night helping me still you know driving me around to jobs to appointments so yeah I'd be lost without her so I've had to make you know huge adjustments but I still have been determined to still work throughout this I think that sometimes it's easy when everything stops working to just like focus on everything that isn't working and my creative I guess um practice has given me something to focus on that is still working because I'm still creative I still have ideas I can still make those ideas come to life I just have to do it in a different way now this is my home studio that I photograph a lot of my work in and it's just kind of my play space as well I take photos of my arrangements and you know they end up I guess on social media but then I also you know make a calendar at the end of each year out of it and sell prints on my um website also so I think that a lot of the beauty comes from using like interesting and things that you wouldn't I guess normally pair with flowers so I love corn like it's just so incredible the um the colors and the texture and everything and then with the humble radish and then with Lily of the Valley which is one of the most gorgeous flowers and scents that you can get if I actually think that it's maybe not going to go together I think that's I'm on to the right thing if that makes sense because is I think pairing things with what you don't maybe traditionally think of going together and all you can do is have a play and see if it works like I started out this and I even was like oh maybe this isn't going to work but then as you go along you start to see I guess how things can intertwine [Music] together I think that like my view on the world is that I do like to change like I guess the context of how you perceive things I like having that like oh what is that oh oh how did that how did she do that or how is that created I don't need to kind of recreate nature because nature does a great job I need to put my own spin on [Music] it [Music] you already know what time it is we're putting your inspiration into action here's your jobs for the [Music] weekend cool temperate gardeners the arrival of awesome Autumn weather is imminent start prepping beds for winter crops removing spent summer

Subscribe http://ab.co/GA-subscribe Think like ...,,deciding to create a garden is one of the best decisions that you'll ever make in life but like anything along the way there are things that can trip you up so i'm going to show you just how to get around them [Music] one of my top tips is to always think like a beginner gardener never be afraid of asking questions ask your nana and your pop your neighbours everyone loves to give help and you never stop learning i'm always learning and that's really important [Music] it is very tempting to grab your wallet and whip out to the local nursery and buy everything in sight but that's precisely what you shouldn't do start off small think small quantities of things and where to put them in fact you might find that over the years some plants do die but at least that gives you an indication of plants that will survive and the whole thing about this is that it's giving you experience and hence more confidence [Music] this is a community garden and places just like this are where budding gardeners first put a fork into the ground one such gardener is my friend isabel robinson good morning isabel hello team this is looking good ah thanks she's asked me for a bit of advice and i'd love to help her where i can isabella what got you into gardening um well i've always been interested in growing my own food um and i don't have much of a sunny garden at home so i'm just trying to learn as i go by putting different edible things into this community patch so if you have any advice that you can offer i would really appreciate it well the first thing would be to know your limitations that's really vital yeah you're down by the coast the community garden is right on the scene so it's got very sandy soil and you just have to keep adding into that sandy soil just so it keeps sort of absorbing all the nutrients so i've brought you a bag of something oh a present oh how delightful i would say every year late winter into spring see how that it's you've got it looking nice it's nice and friable what does friable mean that is such a good question it basically is like when you make a cake and you know how light and fluffy it is yeah well this soil conditioner is made up of a lot of composted bark and a bit of sand and you can see how it falls apart easily yeah which means that there's a lot of air space in there and air's got oxygen in it and it's what the roots really need to grow we forget what's under the ground and i see you've got a bit of um horse manure in there which is just rotting down nicely yes yes i got some of this over summer and yeah i just kind of spread it around yeah let it let the worms do the trick yeah that's good and everywhere you see that it's compacted just fork that over with a little trowel or a fork and then add this into it and you'll find it really will help [Music] a question i've got is what do i actually have room to plant yeah it's fair enough too because if you want a plant like this apple tree see how tall it is and it is really growing very wide and quite dominating it will have a fantastic crop on it you know productive wise but do you want your whole garden bed to be taken over by this one plant if you do that's fair enough but you might prefer just to have one like this that has got lots happening in it you know potatoes and silver beet and oh golly all sorts of things the cabbage family kale [Music] following on from having the space for things these broccoli are doing well because they have plenty of room to reach their maturity think about the final size of your crop it'll tell you on the seed packet or the plant label [Music] and and the other thing is seasonality if you notice that you when you plant things and you end up with a glut yes i have ah what kind of things uh zucchini i had way too many and i had to give them away and some of them went to baldy that's right yeah you keep your eye out for just when they're right to pick yeah and it is true if you can sew things so that you have a lot coming in then and then two weeks later plant some more so that they're going to be two weeks behind yes and you will you get into that habit of just thinking about oh i can plant that and then that and you'll get that nice continual rather than everything coming coming at once [Music] is there a plant that would bring the bees in surely is that's a really great question for a beginner because i would always suggest a salvia they're easy to grow and they bring the birds and the bees and they need pruning once the flowers finish and that teaches you how to prune so it's really doing a good education job to grow a plant like a salvia [Music] how do i know where to put a particular thing in the garden i would suggest you take a photo you know cameras are part of your hand now so take a photo and take it around to some of the older members of the people here yeah and ask them or take it down to your nursery and they'll be able to help you and don't forget the label will tell you the height and the width of the plant so you can go by that and also it tells you how much sun it will require a common thing for beginner gardeners to do is to over water plants now water is essential of course but you've got to have really well-drained soil because if a plant is sitting in boggy saturated soil the roots are going to rot and you can easily get fungal disease on the leaves so make sure the soil is well aerated and nicely tilled up and you'll be fine now the same applies for fertilizer don't use too much just go with what it says on the label or the bag because if you overdo it you can often kill the plants and anyway you could be wasting that fertilizer it could just get leeched out of the soil [Music] what if a plant dies i can nearly bet you that most people here would have lost plants i've lost lots and lots of plants over the years and don't get too hysterical it's just one of those things maybe you didn't do the right thing but you'll learn from losing that plant and it's all an experience to which you get more knowledge and more confidence and that's the big thing not you reckon it's confidence that's the thing yes of course my confidence is slowly building and your knowledge is too i notice it yeah well thanks good thank you so much jane for your advice good to see you good say hi to the family see you [Music] the biggest tip that i can give to beginner gardeners is not to be afraid of making mistakes every mistake means a lesson learned and the more you learn the better gardener you'll become so go out and enjoy it [Music],,,,

to see you and um what a wonderful what a wonderful day today to be finally uh launching the new website i know it's been up and and going but you know punctuation i think punctuation is key you know good punctuation in language means you can communicate better and and that's really what the website's about it certainly is it certainly is castro i'd just like to acknowledge i'm coming to you today up here in darwin on uh from lara kia country and uh certainly myself and uh everyone at community gardens australia would like to pay their respects to elders past present and emerging this land has never been seeded it's a really exciting day for us koster we've worked long and hard to to get this new website up and running and uh get these resources in a in a functional space so that people can access them um as you've mentioned already there's obviously a couple of people out there looking for gardens that are close to one of the biggest things that we have available to the public on our website is our directory of community gardens all over australia so we've got around about 600 gardens currently listed there we know there's a lot more out there so if you know of a garden that's close to you that's not on our website please jump online and add your listing it doesn't cost you anything and it only takes a few minutes to to pop your details in there and you can also be listed on our map you can just put your suburb in or the name of your garden if you know what it is and it'll beautifully zoom in on one of those fancy maps and show you exactly where to go so that's one of the great things that we've got available on our website but there's also a whole heap of other resources there too costa we've got everything from checklists on how to start a garden to some more in-depth documentation there's whole templates that you can use to help your planning experience to help you ensure you set up your governance of your garden correctly because a lot of gardens tend to incorporate and become their own association there's lots of different ideas on on how you can plan things like your organic or permaculture aspects of the gardens and designing and there's heaps of information on different foods and fruits veggies where to grow them what time of year to grow to be planting all of that sort of thing so yeah endless endless resources there's lots of documents on rules that you could set up for your garden um and we're just working on now getting all the different in corporation documents so we're just the links to websites where you can incorporate your association in each state so huge huge amount of resources there for people to access so we're really just wanting to let everybody know that it's there and to jump online and and have a look around let us know if you think there's any bits and pieces we could add to the site as well if there's something specifically you've been looking for as a community garden and it's not there we'd love to know about it because we'll do our best to get those extra resources online for you wow look it it's fantastic i mean already we've got marianne uh he is saying you know didn't know about this site thanks for sharing our garden at willoughby is on camera eagle land like it's so good that even people within the community garden um world don't don't necessarily know about about the site and and and what you've got on there is i mean all that governance stuff it's important because a community garden is bringing people together and if you want it to work you you want that that knowledge that from people that have done it already yeah exactly costa as you said there's um there's a lot of power in community and in networking together and that's uh one of the things that community gardens australia sort of really brings to the fore it's an opportunity to network with other community gardens um and as you you said then too the governance side of things is really important if you get that right from the from the get-go um you're gonna have really good engagement with your local community and be able to see your garden go from strength to strength so they're the types of resources we're trying to pop there online to really help people achieve the best that they can out of their gardens yeah that's it because i i mean people coming together you you want to be able to um really bring the the best out in in the resources that a community has and and if if it's all if if you've got that kind of basic structure from the start i mean i see that the gardens that thrive in in the ones that i've seen around all around the country and and when when community gardens get those years behind them it's only because they've built them on a good foundation and and what the website's offering is this this really good reinforcement to put in the foundations exactly exactly and there's been some wonderful work by done done by a lot of different people around australia over the years um there's a fantastic um booklet we've got a link to on the site the growing communities handbook that was developed in south australia really great resource for the new startup gardens and for existing ones too they've got some really good stuff with ongoing governance and that in there we've got a fabulous couple of there's a as i mentioned before a checklist for starting your garden and then there's a template and a um sort of a management plan that was done by our own russ grayson that's a really good step guide into setting up a new garden you know yeah what the full russ is so yeah yeah and i mean this is this is what's really nice i mean the fact that for those of you that don't know russ russ grayson and fiona i mean they they have done an incredible amount of work with community when it was called um city farms and community gardens network and and and you know that they they did an amazing amount of work and they are still a wonderful part of it even though they've left sydney and they're now living down in tassie and and then you know that the bat that they've handed over for you um and what what you're taking to the next level it's it's wonderful to know that you know that they're they're part of that reinforcement uh yeah yeah they're like the eldest statesman of the community gardening world i i reckon they're uh fabulous both of them and this i'll take this opportunity now i was going to do it shortly but um fiona is actually the one who has built this new website for us so a huge shout out from all the team at community gardens australia to the wonderful fiona campbell for this amazing website that we have now so you'll see bits and pieces change on it over over the coming few months where i think a website's something you always want to tinker with and you want to keep trying to get it right and we appreciate getting feedback from people we've got a fantastic new membership system online there as well now makes it really easy for people to join up and support our work so we also encourage everybody to to jump on and join us as a member if you if you can um together we are stronger so that's that's one thing to keep in mind but

thank you it's a beautiful morning here on the gold coast uh it's lovely to have you and thanks for um jumping in on our itinerary it was a very clear landing unfortunately i can only fly in like this at the moment but [Music] how long's it been going uh we were established in 2011 uh here on the northern gold coast and we're actually down the back of a school which enables us to use a part of their land which is very good of them [Music] yeah so we've got 25 beds all raised garden beds and everybody shares in everything that comes out of the gardens on sunday mornings okay so so your model is one in all in and then one harvest for all not not private plots exactly we think it works better just in this area um and then that way everybody just gets a little bit of everything instead of just having one bed you can have heaps and heaps of produce and all different things and was that a was that a decision that you made early on or did it that was made right right at the beginning how many people were were in the in the community or the committee to start with what was your kind of um how did what did you grow from um we grew from absolutely nothing there was nothing here everything had to be put in like the um the fencing the sheds um just everything there was just a strip of of grass really and um from from 2011 we've actually grown to a whole garden of 25 beds we've got a shared greenhouse compost bins and a beautiful patio area where we always have coffee every sunday morning after we're finished and what's been your your major funding uh model have you are you is the land connected to council or is what what's the land that you're on yeah no we um we could do bunnings barbecues um two or three a year and and that keeps us going for the whole year because um we don't spend a lot of money we do a lot of um volunteer planting you know you get lots of volunteer plants coming up um and we we just recycle a lot of stuff you know we don't really spend a lot of money yeah fantastic i got a comment here you like this um you like this joan from adrian hello i love the work that community gardens do in many ways it's much much more than just growing plants absolutely absolutely it's a it's a social thing which is very important for lots of people especially in these times yeah exactly so can you um and and look to everyone listening if you've got any questions from joan rack them up and uh and i'll throw them throw them on to the chat here yeah but um john do you want to take us for a bit of a wander and just give us a quick overview of the garden let's see if i can work this camera hang on ah you you smashed it out in the test run before we started oh here we go so um we're just starting up the top of the gardens uh as you can see there's a choco vine over there lots of cabbages um broad beans and we've got a beautiful lime tree just there as you can see i've got a herb garden there with vietnamese mint all mints we've got uh compost on um all sorts of different herbs in there i don't know if you can see there is the sun in the way no no it's everything everything looks like it's on like steroids it looks fantastic lemons and mandarins that that lime tree just there is um probably about nine months of the year we're getting limes off that wow we're just walking down here we've got nasturtions tomatoes you can see how far back the garden goes from here yeah it does is that bush is that a bushland corridor that you butt onto or is that part of the school there that's a park so the school backs onto a park so it's absolutely beautiful and quiet here you come here and you just feel so relaxed so just walk down here just a little bit so you can see kale over there beans tomatoes just pop up everywhere we hardly ever plant tomatoes passion fruit just there um i've got dragon fruit over on the fence oh wow elder flowers growing there am i going slow enough for you yeah just that that pace is working nicely good um lots of turnips and carrots and kale our garlics over there is just ready to be um harvested pretty soon i think a little bit of garlic got carrots and things over there um some more um a fig tree just over down there you can see on the horizon [Music] tell us a little bit tell us a little bit about those structures you've got um is that electrical conduit that you then throw by the um just throw the wire over the top netting yeah and then you can pick it up and just move it around because it's just into slots in the garden uh so so can you go in close and show us how it's attached to the to the garden bed yeah so can you see here looks like that just pulls out you can see it oh i see that you've got you've got a dowel in the ground of piping and you just took it over the top yeah yeah exactly so it's pretty simple um and it's not permanent so you can just change it around to whatever bed that you want exactly and that way we can you know just um make sure that we're not putting the same thing in um you know all the time we can change it around to wherever we want to go to yeah that's great yeah lots of beetroots and and um you do the marigold so we've got lots of flowers around it as well we've got the thai basil which actually brings in all the bees the bees absolutely love the thai basil and then we let things go to seed like um you can see up here so all of the um the bees come to that as well there's even a native bee nest just outside the fence that we saw the other day hi the rooster's just wanting to join the conversation yeah so that's our little shed up there that's where we have uh morning morning tea after we're finished got lots of leeks in here and um garlic you know the um oh society garlic decided to go like that's the one yeah um is that a couple of um is that a couple of uh humans i i see yeah working away in the background hi he's waving to you so i'll just take you into the shed just in here yeah show us around the shed this is where we all have morning tea built you'll see some of the produce that we've got here and up on the board there we put up the jobs that need to be done for the day so people just come in and go so what has to be done what has to be done today run us through the the list okay so bed five weeding bed ten we're planting zucchinis thirteen we're doing radish and lettuce today 16 we're removing some of the old lettuce putting in some parsley and kohlrabi weeding and planting it's lots and lots of weeding all the time but this is our produce for today so far i'll just take you along there look at that it looks like it looks like the kumbaba sort of agricultural show they're gonna have to come and then we all just sit around here and have tea and coffee after we finish and you know then it becomes a social thing we all sit around and chat so people get to know each other quite well wow i'll just take you just slowly down to the back here how's that naomi that's amazing uh greenhouse which we took the sides off because the things weren't growing very well and it gets more sun in there now so it's a lot better we've got the shed here where we've got all of our tools so nobody even needs to bring any tools everything's here does that i had a question here um yeah and someone said does does the school engage with you at all um yes they do but they have their own um stephanie alexander garden that the kids do yeah right next to us so um we help them out if they want it but they they tend to do their own thing with the stephanie alexander garden for the kids um and this these pumpkins have just popped up by themselves we've got about four of them on there at the moment pumpkins are amazing how they do that yeah and over here we've got just the soil that we use and manure and compost so that's the whole area wow say hi to an incredible garden joan yeah it's pretty good we like it just beautiful awesome we just transplanted our lemon myrtle [Music] oh that yeah that'll go that'll go gangbusters with a new pot there's all our house yeah mulch what we're trying to do here costa is um trying to grow more things that grow better in this area because um there's lots of things like spinach and you know all of those things that come from england that don't do well in the heat so we're finding a lot of like um okinawa spinach and you know all the different ones like that that we're trying to plant we're doing things like cranberry hibiscus different things that are just love this area and you can use them for salads and things and you don't have to worry about them wilting in the summer you can see the beans that's a nice that that's a nice part of the process yeah so these things these things around here i i got the idea from the gardening australia where you put the comfrey in the pipe and then you get the juice out of the bottom and then you put it on the garden yeah that was i did that story with nev sweeney from permanent culture yeah yeah um for anyone uh for anyone that hasn't heard of nev before look up under the choco tree yeah and he is an amazing community powerhouse and he's recently released a fantastic book on how to run how to run a committee um yeah with lots of ideas and um yeah it's it's fantastic i'll i'll find the link and i'll put it in the chat here after during the day we've got a couple of pineapples there and uh sweet potato just in a big bag there trying to work out see if that works and some potatoes in bags along here oh that's fabulous strawberry bit we're getting heaps of strawberries this year we're using a lot of coffee grounds oh yeah and they seem to love that have you got pomegranates lucas asked no no pomegranates we don't have a lot of space for trees oh yeah the fig tree's up against the fence and that'll be just kept against the fence you know anything that spreads out too much we try to um just keep it flat yes that one lime tree it's a beauty yeah so that's the gardens is there any other question um yeah jane i just wanted to ask you you guys um use some of cga's resources um can you maybe tell everyone a bit about what you found on our website and how it was useful to you guys

one final question i thought are the garden beds wicking beds or are they just normal gardens they're just normal beds we have our own irrigation so it just comes on every night we don't have to worry about watering which is fantastic fantastic well well joan thank you for taking the time to walk us around your wonderful um everyone's loved it if you get a chance have a look at some of the the chat that's gone on i've been putting them up as you wandered us around but uh okay it's been fantastic say hello to everyone from us oh well thanks costa thanks naomi okay then thanks so much bye bye hi so cluster i've got uh katie here with me because we're um we've zipped back over the other side of the country again up to the back up to darwin and um katie's here we're at our community garden in uh grey in palmerston so i'm going to hand you over to katie now and she can take you for a wander around i just wanted to say one of the reasons we've chosen all these gardens to visit today are gardens that have actually used some of our resources before and and our garden here at harvest corner wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the resources that i found nearly 10 years ago on cga's website so absolutely instrumental in helping us to start this garden initially and that was before i was on the committee or even thinking about being president i was just getting involved in my little community garden but we found all of these fabulous resources all the info sheets that june uh joan just mentioned um and they they were absolutely instrumental in helping us get this going so i'll pass you on to katie and uh she can take you for a wander around the garden excellent and then and then we'll and then we'll go over to wa yep okay no worries hello katie good morning costa lovely to um lovely to to to to have you part of the the tour with us i'm just going to put up um i'm just going to put up your uh your community so you're you're called harvest corner yes that's right and uh for anyone that wants to have a look harvest corner is uh there's a website there also on facebook and instagram so it's actually a really good thing everyone to to keep an eye on the facebook and instagram pages of different community gardens to see what's growing in different parts of the country at different times but uh katie take us take us out on the road and and show us around as a little um background when did the garden begin uh the garden began one second oh got a phone cover getting in the way high tech why why not let me switch to the back camera custard back done i'll just go to a few comments during the break harvest corner gavin dobson says it's amazing hello from gloucester in new south wales community garden good on you terry um see you later uh spencer and the save the sunrise glossies no worries thanks for joining us uh what did they use on the ground between the garden beds over at jones i think it was mulch i think it was um arborist mulch from what i could see um and megan gray has a gorgeous community garden behind the library in bunbury i used to do our play group there oh that's i'll have to check that one out when i come to bunbury um all right it looks like it looks like naomi and katie are frozen so maybe what i might do while they come back i wonder if um if we go we might go down to darlington community garden and catch up with louise and trish so just as a little background darlington's in the hills above perth and um they've just had a big launch of new amenities i've been told so uh let's let's bring louise and uh let's bring louise and trish on um here we go good morning louise good morning lovely lovely to uh lovely to see you and we've got so trisha's trish is here as well hello trish hi costa hi louise good morning good morning so give give everyone a little bit of a a background on on the darlington community garden when it began and where you're up to trish i'll let you do the background okay sure so three years ago we are looking at our skate park area and looking to develop that and we had some plans drawn up for the whole area and the landscape architects suggested to us that we might want a community garden so that was the first first time it was the idea was floated and we put it on the local facebook group would anyone be interested in a community garden and about 12 hours later we had 150 members and wow it was going off so um so we thought oh we'd better get this into gear so that was three years ago but it was part of a larger project so we've built a huge arbor which louise might be able to show um as the spine of our garden and then we've got the north side and the south side so we're quite in our infancy but we do have around on our facebook group now is about 500 members it's going to be an open it's going to be an open plan um free range garden with this massive great arbor um down the middle so uh that that's where the idea came from and we do have some neighboring communities like glen forest who have a very well established community garden so we've always been looking over the fence seeing what they're doing and trying to stay on top so if if you see our arbor in the photo there and louise's dog um we've just done some earthworks to the area so um the arbor is you know 20 or 30 meters long i think it's six meters wide and three meters high it's actually made from recycled steel uh drilling rods so one of our values is resta um sustainability and we're trying to use recycled materials where possible um and louise is just showing you through there we've got some rocks that have been salvaged from a local area and we've literally just planted we had a launch on the weekend and we've um just planted our first tree um so the whole area either side of the arbor has been ripped and because it was a an old pony site it was a clay area we've had it ripped and it's been mixed with yellow sand some gypsum and some old mulch just to get us started so that we've actually got a reasonable foundation and to try and help with some of our drainage problems um but you can see that just what we're looking at now is the pump track and the skatepark which over the three years we've actually built and this is a really unique project because this has been an entirely community built designed you know the vision the design and the um and the build has actually been community built so it was the skate park first the pump track second now the arbor and now the community garden can get cracking louise do you have anything to add there yeah just that um it's just been an amazing effort we've got the legs of the arbor here they're made from drill pipe and we've used materials we're trying to continue the theme of the railway we've got a heritage railway site nearby over there in the distance so we're continuing the heritage scheme and just to emphasize what trish said about sustainability and recycling all these rocks were salvaged from a bridge in the village that the shire was re-engineering so one of our earthworks guys off his own bat went and reclaimed all these stones and these are what we're planning to use around our garden so it's all about recycling and sustainability and we're planning to have a recycling station as part of our garden we've got a lady who recycles tops of bottles like milk cartons etc so people bring these down at every meeting and those are going to be melted down by a local guy to make a bench so we're going to have a recycled bottle top bench in our garden which is fantastic so the garden as you can see is just in its infancy um but we're very excited about building some beds and costa would like to get your advice about what to grow up the arbor because it's metal um we just don't want any plants to burn on it we've got some railway sleepers here and the plan is at the moment that we have some beds with marine wire going from the beds up to the arbor so we can grow plants up there and there's a plan too to have to be able to hire out this arbor and the community garden for weddings um and birthdays so we're planning to have long candle-lit dinners long tables stretching along the length of the arbor surrounded by beautiful gardens be fantastic if you could sit at your table and just reach out and pluck a grape from any vines that are growing down growing on the arbor so one of the themes we've picked up here is darlington used to have a big vineyard here in this valley before the oval was constructed and we're planning this is what the arb has done actually it's picked up the theme of the vineyard by having this yard constructed as a great patrollist so that's what this is yeah and we are we also any advice costa would be gratefully received as to what to grow up this arbor yeah well we've got a good brains trust listening in today so uh let's uh let's put it out there and see what people think i i noticed um one of one of the uh one of the great repurposes reuses and recyclers and rethinkers that i know in the country andrew o'sullivan who some of you who are long-term viewers of gardening australia may know he was he was a presenter on the show that bought that whole idea of repurposing and reusing um to the fore and he he made an interesting point he said he said you know what you're doing is reusing um and and that reuse to create that form is is simply spectacular because you know compared to to recycling um i suppose it's it's cycling those old products around but it's actually reusing them and i i like i like that point because you're saving so much energy and you're using something that is is capable of transforming it's it's its former use into a new one and it it's it's a massive scale like that's that's that's the makings of a botanic garden structure about this garden and what's really awesome is the fact that the whole community is involved whether it's sourcing stone doing engineering works we've got different teams on the committee so we've got a horticultural team that's advising us on what to plant and how to construct the beds so yeah any advice about garden bed construction we would love to hear fantastic well look i mean everyone everyone that's on here um has has seen it now and and all the replay viewers so it's all the replay viewers you'll be able to contribute additional comments and already some comments are coming in so it will be a wonderful one to watch and i'll uh if you can send me some photos i'll put a post up and um yeah i think it's it's nice to put to put these ideas out already you know uh paulie said you know growing native climbers to attract beneficial insects to work hard in your veggie plots is is a nice idea compared to trying to grow something that that might struggle on that structure whereas a native climate will will probably be able to handle the heat um peyton said have you considered wrapping the arbor posts in rope so the plants don't burn and gives them something to grip on to so there's there's lots of little ideas coming out already and that's just two people in that's great in 20 seconds you know so i think if um if we put it out there as a proper post um i'm sure we can get lots of people contributing ideas and and you you know like yours is on a massive scale these are things that people can can build out of and and repurpose materials on a small scale like you saw what joan had just with the conduit as a structure and that wasn't for an r but that was actually just for a run for for protection from pests so um yeah wow people are loving it people are absolutely loving it um and and is there a just from a governance point of view how do you operate is it a committee is it connected who are the representatives on the committee where are you drawing from the all the representatives are community based we held a workshop earlier in the year and we invited the whole community along and from that workshop we we worked out what people wanted we had two designs for the garden so we've had two landscape designers design different aspects of what can go on the ground and how it can be used one of the um one of the things is people want to have a harvestable garden that we can eat produce from there are other people who'd like to have a bush tucker garden so we're really showcasing all the native plants which can be used and eaten in an indigenous sense from the past and then this community garden so the committee was established after that first workshop and we probably had 20 plus people attend and of those people we invited them to sit into on tables which for areas of interest to them so one of those was admin one of those was horticulture one of those was design and then we've established teams from those people who are then leading what we're doing in on the committee so when we have our committee meetings which are very dynamic and there's a lot of conversation and we're actually thinking we need to go to the wooden spoon because there's so much passion so you can only speak when you hold the wooden spoon so those people what we're doing is we're tasking the individual teams to come up with things and then they hold their own meetings to advise on the various aspects so i know the design team is due to meet again soon to talk about the design and the hard landscaping the horticulturalists are meeting to discuss what plants to plant and hence your advice about what to grow on the arbor is so welcome so yeah very passionate team on the committee and managing them all is um is interesting i i that there's been you you'll have to uh have a look at some of the great comments that are coming through but you know having other public attractions like the state park means the garden will be enjoyed by all um um all ages pixies corner for the little little kids um fairy events and goblins so they can come along and dress up and play in the area we've got the teenagers and then we've got the younger kids two dads who are now using the pump track i'm just going to pan around so you can see the pump track so we've had grant's helpers set up all this hard infrastructure and so the next thing is the planting which would be exciting well beth brewster said the skatepark means that young ones will see the benefits and possibly lend a hand in the future because they're going to be there anyway and and i think that's really good because then the skate park doesn't become this generational great wall yeah let's put the skate park in the back blocks you know hidden away somewhere and then wonder why why people are scared of those like why older people get scared of those places putting it all in means that everyone's there all the time so it's safe there's no fear involved that's exactly right that's exactly right this is for the whole community and it's about melding the whole community so we have something for everybody wow well look thank you both so much let me um bring you all back up um um you know it's wonderful thank you thank you for um so so trisha and louise thanks for getting up early and and giving us a chance to have a look around your garden and to be part of this launch of the of the new community gardens website um you know you can be a wonderful part of the web of the network because the scale with which you're bringing everyone in and and managing the expectations that's a that's a true community project it's not saying we're doing it this way and that's the or the highway and and that doesn't mean it makes it easier but easy is only relative to what you perceive and you know the wooden spoon ideas fantastic you know these are fun things that make communication all the more relevant um across generations and it's not it's not it's imposition of well we we're the generation with the power and the control and you just do what we want sort of things so and and at that scale like it's amazing what you can tap into when you have people you know one local person has a machine they can clear the area in 10 minutes you know someone knows how to build they build an arbor like that like that's a serious construction but i think the interesting thing was that you got the design input and you weren't afraid to design because that means that you take the whole project to the next level by having that that design foundation as well so cost of that arbor was actually part of the bigger plan it was funded by a federal grant um and it's actually becomes the property of the shire of mundaring um but we are the custodians of that area and we have a lease which includes the the arbor um so we're now an incorporated group and we we won't take care of it structurally but uh hopefully there won't need to be a lot done for a while but we will take care of the um you know what grows on it and and what goes around it we've also bought a um a heritage goods van like a railway wagon and we'll be bringing that to such shortly and that's going to be our tool shed and our hub that we operate from um and also through the arbor is actually going to be part of that the local heritage group uh doing a a walk around the village that they've proposed so we've got all these different inputs from heritage um uh we've had no nana our local indigenous elder come up for the launch and explain to us the the local totem for the area which was a goanna we're planning to build a main garden bed in the shape of a goanna um just just as a little bit of input and a little bit of recognition to our indigenous owners of the land and we're we're working with many groups the shire you know the department of communities um who have given us a grant to get started with the garden beds um our local bendigo bank who have been fantastic and bunnings you know all these different stakeholders that really come together i mean we haven't got we've only got one tree in the ground yet but it's i always use the analogy you know it's like bad bamboo that it's in the ground for nine months and then it springs up and comes to life in a hurry so we we're pretty much sure that that's what's going to happen now we're going to see some some blossoming of the garden now that we've actually got access to the site and we've set up all those and made those connections with the various people and departments to to keep us connected and that's what community gardening is all about guys it's uh really amazing to hear your story the startup journey of darlington it's pretty fabulous isn't it that's that's that's how it rolls everyone coming together and uh and enjoying that journey and being a part of that process together it's really really fabulous i wish you guys all the very best looking forward to seeing it thank you so much yeah we're looking forward to seeing it grow too and that's the next phase yeah yeah we'd like to keep getting updates so we can pop it in our newsletters and that and let people know how you're going yeah great thank you for louise thank you both for um for jumping up early and uh and getting out there and and showing us around it's it's so great to see and now we're going to have a look around um with with naomi and katie around their garden but to go from jones to yours and to see a garden that's 10 years old and been built on a different model to then see the scale of your garden like this has been a wonderful odyssey today because you've just given us such an aperture blowout it's just like gone from from you know this traditional idea of the community garden that joan has to then this this one that you're doing on a on a different scale but the foundations and the model as naomi said it looks the same and you're growing the community in the process so thank you very much for for being a part of it and i'm sure we're going to get you on another odyssey and um come for another tour in uh in in the the month and years ahead thank you guys all right amy see you later thank you see ya bye bye bye wow what a garden yeah isn't that amazing and so nice to see it just as a building like with these structures climbing out like yeah yeah to hear about that process that you know they've had landscape architects they've got you know the other the the community the the council they've got the skate like that that whole you can feel the community involvement there yeah you really can can't you it's quite spectacular it's um i'm very much looking forward to watching their journey through the years because uh that's that's really powerful they've obviously got a fabulous community in and around them that's supporting the growth of that garden so i think they're just going to go from strength to strength aren't they oh you can you can see it i i mean that that that structure alone and then it's not about it's not about having to build a structure like that because that's not what community gardeners uh like it's not about going in on that scale but i think it's also nice to see that you can get that sort of scale with the same community the local small community thinking because the resources are there all of those people are living there you know whether it's the the the the person that built the footings and and designed the detail to sit the steel on and the person that got the steel and the other person with the machine like they're just your next door neighbor and you ask them and they go well yeah i'll give you a hand and and suddenly you get this result which you know to do that as a commercial project you know you'd be talking you'd be talking tens and tens and thousands of dollars like you have to build that arbor like that's that you know where do you get those materials then the labor then the design it's wonderful to see absolutely yeah it's incredible so we um take you for a wander around yeah because we're closed out some really insane electromagnetic field stuff going on so she's able to shut down a phone with a single handhold so um hopefully when i hand you back to her now it doesn't happen again [Laughter] all right let's go hello again yes yes okay how do i turn around yep we'll switch the camera around here oh she done it again oh my gosh there you go now you're right i think so meg said i love wisteria yeah yeah you got to be careful i agree uh looks like they've got they got um uh i don't know she's still with us annie cason it's been great to share um so we've got a uh a little bit of um i'll just come back in here and uh that they seem to each time they've gone to change the camera it seems to have created a a little bit of a a problem um but while we're there uh you'll see oh hang on here's katie so katie's coming in let's okay here we go and oh my gosh i have lots of camera camera um options on mine only one of them oh look at that oh here we go yes hello that was a photo bomber there yeah yes there's we've got the kids here so i'll i'll come over to the to the back corner about that that's what used to be our plots over there so you can see that's not quite garden anymore we've got a fabulous community centre going in which will be a real hub in our in our community which we're looking forward to well just one sec magenta you need to be on the other side of the camera we're getting tech savvy yeah okay so um we've been given this lovely new space out this side to redevelop and reshape our garden so we're in the planning stage and they've put a nice new fence around for us so we know where our boundary is now and we need to get planning before the wet season sets in so a massive thanks to palmerston council for helping us get our dream up and happening for the second time around it's very exciting um to we've learned so many lessons over the last 10 years yeah cobalt was a baby a baby in arms when i was first here with everyone and then we got we got busy as mothers do with young babies and families do and we've drifted in and out over the years and now the kids are older they enjoy being down here so we're stepping up and spending more time here and helping with the with the redevelopment so we've got a lot of established trees some of the the bigger trees that we put in initially to to help create a bit of shade they are huge now and they've done their job and the fruit trees have grown up so some of the larger trees are ready to be actually chopped down turned into firewood and um and mulched and reused on site this showcase to the uh pole of rocks there do you recall this costa i it might just look like a partner i've just rejoined the image um yes i recall that very well um when i visited oh it must have been about 2 000 and when would it have been 15 maybe 15 i'm thinking 15 14 something like that and uh as part of it i i helped construct i remember it clearly and i i remember a couple of those rocks uh leveraging them into position um yeah it's great to see that it's it's become it's become a a place a place on the map it's been it's been fenced off as a a historical item historical historical herb spiral that the gardeners were with the reconstruction were like you can do whatever you need but do not touch the herb spiral just to help you build it we can't get into it at the moment to keep the weeds out and the herbs have unfortunately died but we'll redirect it this is this is put me on to the governor and um so so i mean that area that area that you've been gifted over the other side that's yeah quite a big space it's huge costa yeah it's actually probably given us another third of the uh land that we had before so we got a huge amount of um funding from from the local council to sort of say sorry for having to take out our garden and here we'll give you some money to help you rebuild the new section so um we've got this wonderful blank canvas now to to play with and uh we're going to put in a community composting bays up against the fence so people can come past and throw their compost over the fence into the bays and i'm going to reconstruct another um chicken shed so come down here and see these guys what have we got oh we've got a lizard here yeah we've got a heap of lizards in the garden oh really yeah oh yeah look at him look at the little skin over there he was just chilling right there can you see him there koster um oh oh you hit me yeah i did see him briefly he's up the tree now hello how long has it been going now um we've been here nearly 10 years so yeah it's it's a bit of our people for us having to um you know it's been been a bit tricky with all the construction fencing around and you know the water supplies been on and off and they had to pull down our old fence and that damaged some of our trees and all the rest of it but you know we all made a decision we were happy to sort of roll with the punches while they built this new um fantastic community center and that would be a great thing to be a part of and and we would really enjoy rebuilding our gardens so you know the kids are in here building new paths and stuff at the moment and we've got to we've got a lot of work to do but it's still a a wonderful space and we all enjoy being here so we're going to incorporate some great new features into it for the for the kids with some some play areas and musical equipment and so on and uh get our chickens back there they've been taken off for respite so they're away from the construction workers so yeah apart from the rooster the elusive rooster yes he's uh he's part of the furniture here and cannot be moved you get you try to get close to him and he ends up in the tallest tree so he stays yeah yeah there's no adjustment for that rooster no um but you know looking at this so bearing in mind that all of us have been watching you know on our screens today but when you look at the situation with your garden and you look at the situation with darlington what strikes me the most is that having the community garden near the community center near the skate park near the hubs like yeah we want to build a culture of of and and build a food system that that is um equitable accessible and an educational pathway well it has to be in the places where the community is not not fenced off in the back blocks of of somewhere where there was a a block that was gifted by the council or or something like this like you you know so yeah i look at your garden there and i look at darlington and i say well you're both doing exactly the same thing you're building real resource bases right in the heart of where particularly the next generation is hanging out yeah it's so true costa so true and we've actually been talking to our local scouts group as well that they're probably the only scout group in australia that doesn't have their own scout hall and we've been in discussions with them and we're looking to get some funding to actually build um a scout hall here just right next to us and using a part of our land here as well so that it'll be even more of a combined community resource with scout halls and the community centre and the community garden and we've got the school next door and the red cross across the road and yeah it's um you know we're hoping it'll be a real hub of uh community space in years to come so very exciting it is exciting and i mean you've still got your structure there for your um a few bits of it because we'll probably have to halve the size of this um while we move things around with the new garden we'll probably use the other half of it as our part of our new truck shed so yeah it's all um all happening we'll reuse what we've got here and and uh create things a little bit differently but it's all happening and they've managed to keep our cocoa tree as well in this construction phase and that's where the rooster lives yep well well then cocoa tree and our herb spiral made by costa rica as long as they kept that for us we were happy and the bananas the massive bunch of no what is it banana circle banana clump is outside the fence and we're hoping um be great if the council decided to keep it people love bananas and it's it's such a productive patch it'd be amazing um yeah but you know people don't be able to get fruit on the outside and the inside and even on the outside we're in discussions about what edible things can go outside so people have that option of of harvesting from the the open parks on the outside of the fence as well yeah yeah so um someone just asked where are we we're in palmerston which is just outside of of darwin um and this is the well it was originally called the palmerston community garden wasn't it yeah yeah so we'll just take you up through the middle we'll walk along the children's garden path they've they've made this this new path through the bed only yesterday that started being developed so we can was the construction uh cut off our other path so the kids enjoyed a bit of uh a bit of work there bit of engineering yes and they've been very as as we've cut palms down and other a lot of trees that the birds kindly have deposited over the years um and as we've chopped them down the kids have had an absolute ball reshaping paths so there's lots of garden edging made from all the the tree stumps and the the branches and then getting right into it oh yeah look at this and then are you just going to put um sort of arborist mulch on that like wood chip or yeah we've got um one of the local tree fellas he comes in and uh dumps about 10 meters of mulch any time that we need it so we're going to call him in shortly it's just been quite difficult just recently with all the construction so uh the garden has been let go a little bit but um now that we've got our new fence up and not temp fencing and we can get our access back a lot more easily and the water seems to be on most of the time which helps yes so we'll we'll look at starting to get that mulch in and and popping everything up again before this wet season kicks into too intensely so and all the rest of our thumbs in storage up at the local council offices waiting for for the go ahead um when we can sort of get back in here full time and and really get stuck back into things so yeah we'll get our barbecue back and build a pizza oven and and away we go yeah just a herb garden along the outside of the fence the idea has been very popular with the community at glover's community garden in sydney sydney's oldest community garden yeah yep hello these are our path builders costa oh hello everyone creating the new paths in the garden you're doing a great job i can't wait to walk along those paths when i come to darwin yeah have to get out of here for some pizzas with us yeah absolutely yeah count me in count me in i'll i'll jump in the costa vader and i'll land i'll land there on i'll land on top of the herb spiral that'll be my um my bearing marker as i fly over the top that sounds perfect and we might we'll uh we'll get our smoothie bite back up and happening that's where they always uh get to so our smoothie bike needs a bit of tlc and um tender loving care and that's always the third spot the boys all the kids end up actually to burn off a bit of energy so smoothie bikes are great for community gardens and people with lots of energy uh yeah that's a that's a good point um and it you know when you blend a whole lot of things into a juice it's a way of um of getting access to those to those um ingredients which is which is nice yeah definitely now they um certainly keeps the kids going when we've got them on the on the bike and the smoothie jug whizzing away in the on the front end of it so it's always good to good to happen so yeah so that's a little garden in um an awesome state of reconstruction [Laughter] yeah yeah yeah it's funny i was looking at some photos of it the other day from when we very first um started building the beds and stuff here and then i was looking at some more photos from a few years later when it was all built up everywhere and um and then i look at it now and it's like wow this garden's gone through a few changes over the years but um that's wonderful that's that's part of the experience i think isn't it with community gardens that that's it uh it shops and changes over time and um and you roll with the needs of the community our community here needed a a much more up-to-date and purpose-built community centre so um yeah that that's going ahead which is wonderful it's much more suitable for all the groups that need to use it and um we've we've given up some of our land and been given a whole lot more so yeah we're very much looking forward to building the new part of it so yeah it's been wonderful to take you around well thank you and thank you katie for um for being there and uh being part of that that tour and and you know big congratulations for for getting getting the website and and for this moment to to officially sort of put it out there to everyone and to see the responses of just the people on this on on the live part of the broadcast and hopefully people can share this and get it out to more community gardeners so that they they do know about it because there were a few people that didn't even know about the website and yes that it has um yeah and and there's so many layers to community gardening that there's no one-size-fits-all which which i think is really critical for people to understand and and there's different governances there's depending on who you who you're communicating and collaborating with and and i know there was a comment much earlier and i didn't bring it up back then because it's a it's a big it's a big one in the community garden world at the moment but i know that um the collingwood children's farm is going through um a re-array um that's it right here well yeah yeah and and it's it's a difficult it's a difficult one because yeah they're managed by a government um in instrumentality who have said that the original community garden which which was the way it is being built in in a in a very organic way doesn't sort of meet the standards now and so they've had to close it which has created so much uncertainty and angst and anger and it's it's a it's it's a work in progress at the moment and um and yeah for anyone that hasn't heard about it you know you can you can follow it through the the the um the collingwood children's farm community and it's just an example that that there's there's a lot of layers involved in these things and and um it's an important part of of not not just the transparency but the communication capacity to to be able to sit at a table and and agree to disagree um agree to agree and agree to think about it all of those things and yeah and kind of what life is about and and i think politically you know we've we're sort of in interesting terrain at the moment because politically everything is so it's my way or the highway whereas at the community garden level it's what politics should be about which is not yeah one camp or another it's about everyone being there everyone everyone being independent and that this old party model is the way that you know oh we're doing it this way and you're either with us or against us that's yeah become so divisive the last the last 10 years has become very divisive and i think what i like about the community garden network is that if you're going to do something community you have to put on a different cap and communicate full stop yeah and it takes time you know like it doesn't happen overnight and you you saw with darlington like they're they're really exercising a healthy approach to it because they're not trying to do it overnight they're not trying to build it in 10 minutes but yeah they're building more connections with more people which if that's the end game then you'll get anything you want yeah exactly exactly right and that's that's where that real strength and power in community lies isn't it it's everyone getting an opportunity to to share their part and and be respected and appreciated and and the amazing things that you can build out of that when everybody does have that that opportunity um it really is quite incredible to say the very least so yeah now i know i know we've gone we've gone a bit longer today but there was no way i could sort of just chop the darlington tour and and jones tour because that's really what this is about it's a chance and particularly with a lot of people in lockdown i thought you know it's nice to be able to travel when people can't travel around and and ultimately the topic was the launch of of the website and all the work that's been done and all of the coordination that you've been overseeing and the fact that uh i've got the ticker there that people can join the community garden network yep well we've got a um a fabulous uh prize to in this month too costa as you're well aware so one lucky uh one lucky community garden that uh joins up with us this month we'll uh win a costa station this is a new word we're expecting it to go into the the latest macquarie dictionary when it

http://ab.co/GA-subscribe Watch Gardening ...,,[Music] back in late 2019 gardening australia visited kangaroo island for a series of stories showcasing its amazingly wild and natural beauty i'm heading to the western end of kangaroo island this amazing place is surrounded by 500 kilometers of coastline yet the whole island is home to just four and a half thousand people not long afterwards fires swept across and burned half the island the largest in recorded history two people died as well as an estimated 50 000 livestock and countless native animals and birds 89 houses were also lost including the home of sabrina davies and her family we were one of the unlucky ones unfortunately that were very much affected we lost our house and pretty much everything on our farm which was on the western end of kangaroo island and we had to relocate while we're cleaning up and rebuilding author and academic margie prido also lost everything in the fars including her house garden and animals the overall feeling of this year is one of sadness there's so much around us every day that looks terrible and reminds us of profound loss like most people i was shocked by what happened but was also keen to offer some support in whatever way i could so i started ringing people on the island to see what could be done to help my first thoughts were to send seeds so people could start replanting but with all the infrastructure damage the reality is that that was a long way off so i started thinking what would i want if i lost my garden to fire i'd want it back again [Music] so i got in touch with some kangaroo island residents in the central rural town of pandana to see how we could create a community garden together with the assistance of a small government grant the generous support of the nursery and garden industry some land provided by the local school and of course the overwhelming input of the kangaroo island community we set to work i even roped in my husband richard and sons rowan and toby to come over with me to help out with the construction which amazingly was completed in just one week madeleine kelly who works in the office at the school was one of the driving forces to get things off the ground so madeleine i rang you out of the blue and you got on board why i think mainly because it was a little ray of positive in amongst a very big black hole so i think that was the reason i wanted to do something that was positive the garden is designed around a central seating area with the perimeter of herb beds my vision was to create a space in which people felt enclosed safe and secure surrounded by beauty and produce the most important thing i think is the connection being outdoors because a lot of the other has been indoors going to see a counsellor or having you know family conferences has been somewhere where people have been in a community that's outdoors i guess it was something it was never expected in pandala for a little town that we are it's one of the it's pretty special for us so and i think it's just really important to to have a place like this to um to sit down and unwind after a long day of cleaning and pulling out burn posts and you know whatever else you have to do for the garden to be successful there needed to be caretakers keeping an eye on things luckily the perfect couple lived right across the road and dennis and marie quickly became known as the garden guardians madeleine come to us and said oh would you like to look after the community garden i said oh well i suppose i can i'm not doing anything else so i'll go and do it when they started to build it i went down and spent the whole time while it was being erected and and now that it's got down it's really off easy going and i really enjoy it it's quite a thrill really because you you can see the pleasure they're getting from the garden and a lot of people have said that it's a real oasis especially if they've come from a burnt area it's been a great project to be part of to get this garden up and going quickly i used a method that's worked well for me over the years lots of wicking bits this means that the plants will be kept well watered with less effort and the garden is also portable in case it needs to be moved in the future this is looking fantastic has beetroot been popular it has they look like they need a drink they will sneeze right ready to water yeah right off you go in this few months these bands have just gone crazy too haven't they ever how long ago did you show those two and a half weeks wow fantastic the soil is good it is fantastic when the project first started everybody was like you're crazy for building something here so early after the bushfires but since the herbs and the veggies have come to life so it's the community spirit i think it'll help them through till they can get their own gardens up and running again i will forever be changed by this experience of being among kangaroo islands strong connected and resilient community i have also rediscovered the big impact that something is comparatively small as a garden can make to people's lives i think it's my way of helping everybody it's really hard when you're in this situation we are all so busy rebuilding our own bit that this was a bit that could help everybody so what's the produce that you've missed most from your garden leafy greens dark leafy greens spinach's silver beets the plants are not my plants but somehow i feel very possessive and connected to them i love watching them go through their cycle and there's healing about that about the time with them it's helping me get better it's helping me be whole at a time when everything is conspiring against that happening and i think the garden makes me feel like life is worth going on with [Music] you,,,,

you've made some mistakes, maybe last year's garden wasn't the
best and you really are a little discouraged, then this video is for you. Kevin Espiritu here from Epic Gardening
where it's my goal to help you grow a greener thumb. I think we had something like 16 to
18 million new gardeners in 2020, with all signs pointing to even more
in 2021. And with new gardening, I remember my first time, I mean, I grew hydroponic cucumbers and
they tasted absolutely awful. I think my brother actually said that
he almost threw up when he ate them. And so that's not a good sign. It wasn't
the best first crop for me either. Which is why, in today's video, I'm going to go over maybe nine or
10 of the most common and devastating gardening mistakes that will prevent
you from having Epic harvests. So you know what to do, cultivate that Like button and I will
personally give you a money back guarantee that you will not have any gardening
mistakes. By the way, this video is free. So I'm sorry, the money back guarantee
isn't really worth a whole lot. But let's get into the video. Mistake number one is putting your
garden in an inconvenient location. It's very similar to
working out. You know, you don't want to make your
gym bag really hard to get to. You want your meals ready to go. I
could probably take some advice there. But in the garden, I
certainly have mastered this. And that's because my
gardens are easy to access. What you want to do is make it accessible
and easy to work in, low friction. For me actually, in my raised bed garden
at least, that means a tall raised bed. Really helps me. I'm quite tall and
I don't want to bend down as much. Save my back. Again,
another easy thing to do. But these tiny little things - this
really doesn't even have to do with any gardening practice - fertilizing,
watering, transplanting, starting seeds. It's just where the garden
is in the first place. It's a huge mistake that people
can make when they're starting out. So make it easy to access and
you'll have a much better time. Mistake number two is planting in
an area that doesn't get enough sun, is not a good location for planting. So
I was hanging out by my chimney there. This is my north facing wall.
So this is oriented north. This one is oriented east to west. And
the sun of course rises in the east, sets in the west. So the pattern
of my sun here on my property, it comes from about there in the
winter and ends right about there. What does that mean? It doesn't get high enough right now to
crest over this wall and it also doesn't make it anywhere over there.
And so what does that mean? In this bed I can't really plant much
that's going to need a ton of sun. And so a huge mistake you can
make, as a beginner gardener, is planting things that don't match to
the sun and light availability of an area. The best way to do that
is observation. Maybe 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM - go out and just
kind of see where the shadows fall. And just remember that this is actually
going to change based on the time of year. So a really good resource
I'll leave down in the description. It'll allow you to drag over the months
and it'll show you how the sun will fall over your property. You can type
in your exact address. But again, remember planting is
the most important time. If you make a mistake in planting,
you've locked that plant in stone. Unless you're growing in a container, which is another great way to
mitigate some of these mistakes. But please remember, do not plant in an area that does not
have enough sun for the plant you're trying to grow. Mistake number three is
planting too far from a water source. So I want to show you what I've had to do. I don't have irrigation set
up here at the Epic Garden. I actually have ONE outlet here for
water on the side of my house that's really inconveniently placed. It's in the middle of my house
between the front and the back yard. And so I've used a hose splitter here
and then I've split that many times over. Of course, I'm going to get irrigation. But the reason why you don't
want to do this is because again, it's one of those laziness things. If
you're going to have to lug water over, you might just decide not to do it that
day. And then the day gets too hot. The plants die and you're in a big
world of hurt. And you've again, killed some plants. You
don't want to do that. So let me show you what I've done.
Again, this is not the best solution. I'm still getting irrigation set up
here, but hey, if it works, it works. If it lets me access water then
I'm happy. Like I mentioned, the first thing I've done is split this. So we go to the front yard
with one of the hoses. Now what you could do here is you
could just use a standard hose. But I've put this into a Hoselink, which is a hose bib that has
a retractable reel right here. So this one can extend out about 82 feet
and it can go just about anywhere in this front yard garden. So I've got
perfect access in the front yard. The second hose comes through right here.
We're going to wind around the back. Again, if it works, it works. It's not the most clean setup, but we've gone to another hose
bib right here with the Hoselink. And I can access everything in this
little temporary orchard as well as all of the back garden back
there. Mistake number four, one I admit I have made quite a bit, especially in my first few
years of gardening is not
respecting the power of the mulch. We must respect
the power of the mulch. This is just some bare potting mix right
here, recently amended. And sure, yeah, I could plant right into this
and I'm sure I would be okay. But I can reduce my watering
needs, protect the soil, protect any sort of splash-up disease
type of issues with the use of some kind of mulch. Now, if you've been
watching this channel a while, you know I'm obsessed with this shredded
straw mulch from a company called GardenStraw. It's not available here in the U.S. I
should have it available on my store sometime around April 2021, but don't let the fact that you can't get
the exact straw that I use prevent you from using mulch. There's plenty of
different things that you can use. You can of course, source straw in your
own area. You can use grass clippings. You can use shredded leaves, fall leaves if you're in an area that
gets a lot of leaf drop. I'm jealous, I don't. And fall leaves
are a fantastic cover. Now the couple of things that you
want to keep in mind with mulch. You want to make sure that you
lay down a thick enough layer. I would say at least two
inches or so if possible. And just because I'm in a raised bed
right here doesn't mean that you should only mulch a raised bed. You should mulch your inground plantings
and you should also mulch even smaller containers like some grow bags or
just some patio style containers with something like a straw. You can
do it. It is so, so beneficial. It's going to reduce the
amount that you need to water. It's going to protect the surface of the
soil and there's just a million and one different ways that you can do it. I've got a whole video on cheap sources
of mulch that you should check out. But remember to mulch your garden. Mistake number five is
not preparing the soil, not taking the time to prepare
the soil before you plant. Now, if you're growing in a raised bed or a
container that just means selecting the right container mix, which
I'll do a video on this spring. But let's just take this bed for example. This is the no dig bed that I did in
collaboration with Charles Dowding. And many of you who watched that video, you'll know that even during the making
of that video I was critiquing my own process as compared to Charles, who is
the master of the no dig garden bed. And so I actually ended up making some
changes to this bed based on some of the mistakes I thought I made and then later
knew I made in the soil preparation. So what I did here is I added a bunch
of pumice to this to lighten it up. I was noticing that I was getting a little
stunted growth here in the no dig bed because I think the compost mixture
was just holding way too much water. Just way too much. And so that was a soil preparation
mistake that if I didn't know that, and I had a couple of years
of gardening under my belt, I would've just let that be. And then these cabbage plants would have
just sat here doing nothing for three, four months because they have no ability
to actually take in nutrients and grow. So soil preparation. Now,
if you're growing inground, the first thing I recommend
wholeheartedly, it's a
little annoying to do, is to get a soil test. You have to do this to know what
type of soil you're working with. I have a video on some
DIY soil tests you can do, but nothing's going to beat hitting
up your local nursery and saying, hey, can you put me in touch with
someone who can do a soil test? And they'll give you not only
the composition of your soil, but the nutritive qualities of your soil, how much organic matter is in the soil. Are you deficient in any particular
macro-nutrient as well as, if you want, it's probably a little bit of extra money, you can get a heavy metal
and salt report as well. Just to see if there's anything
really funky going on with your soil, especially when you're planting inground
in a new space because you just don't know what happened in the decades
before you lived in this place. So soil preparation is a massive, massive
mistake that you can avoid, of course, by doing the preparation.
Mistakes number six and seven, I'm going to give you a
two-parter here in this exact bed, is planting things that
you don't like to eat. So here I have some beets
and some kale. Fortunately, I have learned to like beets a lot
more. I like to roast them up now, but kale I've always liked. So these
are two things that I enjoy eating. Now I think what a lot of beginners will
do is they might Google easiest plants to grow, beginner gardening
suggestions, things like that. And then they'll just grow whatever that
says without any regard for if you like to eat that plant. Now, look, I love
growing weird plants, unique plants, plants that maybe I
don't even like to eat. So I do break this rule for the love of
the grow, for the love of the garden. I want to see something interesting and
maybe I'll just give it to someone else who does like it. But if you're trying to grow a garden for
your family and maybe some friends and of course yourself, pick the things
that you actually like to eat. It's a little silly to grow something,
spend all this time and care, to never harvest it. And even if
you do harvest it, not use it, it's just a little bit of
a waste. And number seven, the two-fer here is this is a pretty
densely packed bed now that it's grown in. But I will confess that when things
were getting a little busy here at Epic Gardening, I was not spending as much time in this
particular bed as I would have wanted to. And so I have the beets that I direct
sowed as well as the kale that I direct sowed. But I usually put a couple
of different plants in per hole, a couple of different seeds, just to
guarantee that something germinates. Now with beets you don't need to do that. Beets actually have a
compound seed of sorts. And one what looks like a seed
actually has multiple seeds within it. But still you have to thin
that out. So you can plant, number one you can plant
too densely seed to seed. So you can actually just plant them
too close together. But number two, you can not thin them out
after they've germinated. So what happened in this particular bed, and of course now it looks really good
and I'm really excited, no disease, beautiful structure on
the beets and the kale. But what was happening before was I
had two, three plants right here, two, three plants right here,
two, three, right there. The beets had a couple of different beets
all trying to grow next to each other. And you can do it, they're
just going to be a lot smaller. And that's what happened. They were
just a little bit small, still healthy, but small. And as soon as I thinned them
out and gave them some room to breathe, they all blew up in size. So while small space gardening
is where I came from, and I love cramming
plants in small spaces, you still have to respect there is a
certain limit upon which you can cram things in. Mistake number eight is
planting things at the wrong time of year. And I think this hits
warmer climate gardeners. More than colder climate gardeners.
Because colder climate gardeners, you have a. True beginning and end to your season
with your first and last frost dates. And you can plant things a little
early, a little late, sure. But you're not going to walk outside in
the middle of the snow and be like, oh, it's a great time to grow tomatoes.
It's just not going to happen. Whereas in the higher
zones - zones, nine, 10, 11- you can get tricked because it's
really not too cold at any point in time. I would say maybe about 40
degrees Fahrenheit at the
absolute lowest in some of these zones. And so it looks like a time that
you could plant just about anything. And so I'll get questions from people
saying, oh, I planted my tomatoes. I planted my, you know, my
cucumbers and it's November. Are they going to do okay? And
the answer is technically yes, they're not going to just immediately
die because they know it's the wrong time to be planted, but they're
not going to thrive. And so you have to respect the time
of year that a plant wants to grow. A summer crop like a tomato or a cucumber
of course is going to be best done in late spring through summer. Maybe you can get a second planting
of that if you're in a warmer zone. But you really do have to respect
this. And for me, in my warmer zone, I need to respect that there's certain
plants that like it colder that I just can't grow in the summer. I'm going to
struggle to grow cilantro for example. I'm going to struggle to grow leaf lettuce
in full sun in the summer, of course. So right now in spring it's the perfect
time for me to grow some of those crops and either preserve them, although maybe
not for the lettuce and the cilantro, but just respect the season and
you'll have a lot more success. And if you want to know how to do that, what I suggest is watching my
video on hardiness zones explained. That will kind of give you the
primer on that. And then honestly, ask experienced gardeners,
which leads us to our final tip. Our final mistake is to not lean
on the experience of others. Gardening is a craft has been passed
down generation after generation after generation, all cultures around the world. And there guaranteed are people alive
right now, probably within a mile of you, that know a lot more than you
may ever know about gardening. Because they've been doing it since
they were 15 and they're 80 now. And so ask them how they
do things and lean on them. There's a couple of different
ways you can do this. Number one, if you have someone in your
neighborhood that you know gardens, knock on their door. I guarantee you a gardener is going to
want to talk about gardening with you until they're blue in
the face. Number two, you can go to a local
county extension office. Just Google your city and then
extension office and it should show up. You can call them, you can email
them. They're literally volunteers, master gardeners that their whole job is
to help you succeed in your climate and in your area. And then third,
engage with the gardening community. I actually created a Discord
server for Epic Gardening. We have about 3000 people in there right
now sharing based on where they are in the world. Based on the type
of crop that they're growing. And it's basically just like an online
chat room. So check it out. I created it. We're having a lot of
fun in there right now! So I highly recommend you check
that out. But until next time, hopefully these tips helped you avoid
some mistakes in your upcoming season of gardening. Good luck in the garden. And keep on growing.",,,,

special and uh the first thing you want to do or first thing i want to do is share it and i'm here in saint gilda and uh saint kilda is a community of uh of uh a suburb or a community what whatever you make wanna call it but uh saint hilda is a special place that's maybe a better way to describe it and i'm walking along in saint gilda and i come across this place i come across this this community garden and i gotta tell you over the years i have seen community gardens but i don't know i don't know necessarily that i've seen a community garden like this look at veg out the sign says veg out on it and this is the veggie out community garden saint kilda established in 1998 built and maintained entirely by volunteers and you just gotta you gotta see this is one of those places that

ABC Gardening Australia's TV host Costa ...,,doesn't [Applause] mean overe exertion it doesn't mean effort beyond your means input just means presence input means sharing input means spreading the word it might be a poster it could be a post that we're having a gathering it could be saying to a friend that knows nothing about it hey let's grab a coffee and go for a walk around the gate but there's lots of simple little ways it could be engaging your school class to come out here and get involved and speaking to your teacher and your principal there's lots of schools around here so I suppose what I would what I would urge you as a an energized Community I mean today is an energizing day to get 200 people to turn up for something means that there's momentum but momentum doesn't just physic says momentum p is out but once you have momentum you only need to look at social media and look at the way Computing works when you have momentum if you value if you spin it if you keep generating it if you boost it it goes there and then that again and when it does that again that's when you get out of your immediate circles into Circles of people that may not know and do not know about this and do not necessarily have the background and energy and excitement that you as the the the the early adopters have and that's what we continually need to do I come to these Community Gardens and events like this all the time and it's nothing I love more it's what motivates me people say what am I on I'm on you you know seriously it that you can't you cannot buy this energy you cannot Source it you you have to be it and when you when you are amongst it it it multiplies it really does generate more and more the milk of humankindness is pouring from the heavens um so I'd say this think about think about how you can extend and bring more people to it in little ways little little ways I'm not stopping because you're not going to go anywhere to sit down as soon as it eases I'll stop and you can run at the moment running is not an option going to get suck is my boy I'll keep to rain for an hour I'll just B think about simple ways you can multiply you can be a multiplier whether you have physical whether you have the physical abilities all the Computing abilities all the community networking abilities don't underestimate what you have your family your street your business your buiness community can all grow from this D I'm I'm involved with a really interesting situation up in Budram at the moment I don't know if anyone look it up when you get a chance in the next week Urban food streets and it's a community that has set up seven or eight streets that are producing the most incredible amount of produce for the local residents and they started it themselves and now there's problem because the council wants to come in and make the the gardeners have pay insurance to have their Gardens on the street now the council is by the people for the people so this is something that that I like to talk about because it's something that we're all involved with we need to be conscious of the front line decisions that are shaping and molding the path of community gardening into the future this is a big one this was a community that set this up on their own they didn't ask for anything they kept it lowkey and under the radar until everything was grown until the streets of banana the banana Street produced 850 k always worth of bananas until one house allotment out the front produced last year in 3 months 230 units of greens which you would otherwise go down and buy at the produce markets or at the shop or the supermarket for $3 to $4 a unit we can do this this facility here I see what's set up in 7 months but I see Way Beyond that the Ed educational capacity of this as your Springwood community and that's the bottom line that's what you have to think about this is your community and how you can you can add and engage and bring the community to life in here you know the the the the parish or the school I'm not 100% on the background but either way you've got the land yeah that's the biggest thing right but then you can take this to the next step you can start to take the food Growing Experience to people's houses to their front yards to their burges to their nature strips whatever you want to call them so the people learn here they get seed bank you build the seed bank here this becomes a Haven for the the the the core the core of the growing you have the seed plants here that you can take cuting and then take them to a nature room say right now we're going to start on this street and we're going to go from there and don't underestimate the value of your role modeling you start growing something on your street you influence that whole street I don't know how many people live in your street how many houses a little on L I just moved oh okay we have we have 30 at our street okay 30 houses okay 30 with nature strips and good soil so you know you start doing something you're going to influence 30 people or 30 h Homes or 30 30 households every day at least influence twice a day and like you said and the kids there a little girl here who's very very interested I don't know where she is this little girl here she straight away asked me about companion planting explain yeah so that's the beauty of it so so you know yes each and every just just the Gathering here under the tents you know your influencing power in your immediate streets and communities are enormous and when you build this as you're operating Mecca as your Hub where you come together and and learn and grow like it doesn't matter whether you're horticulturally trained it doesn't matter if you've got a background doesn't matter if your grandparents or your parents were really good at it or not because you've now got them here you got a family of gardeners and Growers that you can grow together and understand you know I can't talked about what I grow down the hill it's different here and that's the key and then you can start to take it to that next step and say all right let's make and you know someone someone here you know sweetheart you might be you know really good with the computer you could gather information and say all right and you speak to the girls and say what are the key elements we need to know about growing zucchini here bang and we make a zucchini sheet we put it in a folder in a in a sheet and then we add the next one and the next one so when I come and visit in 12 months there's literally a fact sheet for growing X number of vegetables or fruit in Springwood and you just keep building that that is pricess you can't buy a book on growing in Springwood but you can make it and if you make that then everyone that comes in gets that to start with and then you can add to that and then you start to say all right well it's not just about the growing what are we going to do with this produce how do we cook it who's got the best recipes what do we do how do we pickle our zucchinis how do we store them when we've got that glut where we start to look feel and taste like a z you know what do we do with our pumpkins what do we do with our you know how do we make stuffed marrows how do we deal with potatoes how do we like and we make that book so that I would say to you that in 5 years when you're how old when you're 15 what's your name sorry loose go Lucy I I would lay the not no it's not even a challenge I'd lay the beautiful goal of saying but when Lucy's 15 you can literally pump out the first edition of the book you don't you don't actually need to right because you just have it cuz actually when it's a when it's in a sleeve someone can take it down to the library and just photocopy and and keep adding the pages but then if I say to you in 5 years time or four years time you then print that book then everyone that comes in can buy a book or you can sell a book and then you start to make some money to do other things but it's the it's the content of the book that's the most important thing cuz that's almost like a Visa well no actually no it's a passport it's a passport for growing and cooking and sharing and understanding so you know I I could go on but I think you know you guys have probably got drenched and you know the the moment has passed but I I'll just leave you with that and say look look at look at this place and imagine imagine when this Avenue is up imagine when you know you can't see the mound of mols at the back because it starts to become mysterious like a garden imagine when there's Bolas and cover and shade and tables and chairs and reason to come but reason to come regularly get out of town come down here and have a picnic regularly bring people bring anyone that comes to town any visitors you have you're going to go out for lunch start ear they're big pieces so maybe I think it's time to go to get your cars undercover um but congratulations and um may may this garden grow really really deep roots and Broad canopy that that that that encompasses Springwood and a little Beyond congratulations wonderful to here,,,,

Subscribe ...,,today I'm on Sydney's Northern beaches in Ivanhoe Park it's a great spot for game of cricket a bit of rugby maybe some bowls or even just a leisurely walk but what if I told you it was hiding a secret a Hidden Gem that most of the locals don't even know about just a stone's throw from the beach and surrounded by the hustle and bustle of modern manly this Park was founded in 1884. locals drive past and might notice the expansive trees but little do they know those huge trees are hiding a pocket of Heritage Botanical Treasures Lloyd what an amazing place the feeling in here it it just totally away from the hubbub of of manly yes been here from around about 40 years or 50 years after they established the colony and it became the place for people to come on weekends to enjoy themselves Lloyd discovered this place in 2003 and after volunteering for five years he's now the president of the friends of Ivanhoe park volunteer group I hear there's some pretty interesting history to this place The Wildflower shows started fairly early on and they were always under the auspices of the government the government house and usually it was the governor's wife that organized them and they used to sweep the whole area pick wildflowers and put them on these houses that they had built in the garden to show people what sort of flowers they would see if they went to say North head or over to Dy so literally one of the earliest Wildflower shows yes but in those days they didn't realize they were actually taking them from the land and not replacing them when the flower shows stopped it enabled the flowers to grow in the area and today fortunately we see wildflowers only because they did stop the flower shows and it's the best scene that's ever happened for this Garden but the whole of the Green Space up and down the coast from one end of the northern beaches to the other what a fascinating bit of garden trivia now it's about time I find the people who keep this garden growing the Beating Heart of the garden the volunteers well well well I can hear the sounds of gardeners at work up here what a place this is amazing up in this part of the gardens so what motivates you to come out on a fine morning like this and get involved love a plant there's nothing more than relaxing than pulling up the weed where did you get this love of plants always loved it it's good exercise you don't see any sick gardeners what do you love about being out here it's got a wonderful history it's rich in its culture with manly standing here and looking out I'm not in manly I'm in the Royal National Park typical Sandstone Rock outcrop the angopher is growing up here it's the way it would have been hundreds of years ago it's very beautiful the people who walk through here when they see us they stop and they just say look you're doing a great job kid guy so it's a good purpose once the park became Heritage the council did a full census of the garden revealing over 400 different plants across about 92 different species and it's got one of the most interesting collections of trees you'll find anywhere in Sydney Lois you've got a pretty good understanding of the trees in this collection why is it so special it's very unique Garden in the northern beaches it's one of the oldest Gardens in Sydney with the what we call our Legacy trees the figs and the Norfolk pines and then over time more and more trees are being added so we have four different oracaria trees including the bunyipine the very large bunyipine and we have five different species of fig and then we have single trees that come from other parts of the world but we have a silk floss trees from South America we have cottonwood tree from America we have a tree from Africa the yellow wood and what is so special about the collection of trees here the Heritage value because the trees that were planted starting in the 1860s but the trees that grow now and Sydney area will not all survive as the climate changes we've been told that Sydney will become more subtropical like Queensland and so some of the rainforest trees that we've got in the garden will probably be the trees that will survive better in Sydney as many years to come this place has a wealth of fascinating plants but it couldn't survive without the dedicated team of volunteers working hard to maintain This Magnificent garden and no matter what their capability everyone adds value I was told I'd find you in this part of the garden Judy well hi what's going on here well Welcome to our sensory garden and it's for people who have different levels of ability in all sorts of ways first of all you'll notice all the beds are nice and high up off the ground yeah the oldies like me who don't want to be down on our hands yeah yeah but also people who are in wheelchairs people who might have different levels of Mobility can appreciate it without having to be down at ground level and then in each of the beds nice soft lambswooly kind of ears yep herbs that have different smells roses when they're flowering beautiful scents color color so it's designed in the different beds to have different ways of appealing to people's senses so uh should you appeal to my sense of weed removal well it is please have a trowel go here we go Lloyd I have had the best day I can see why you love this place I'm glad you can we've got to tell more people about it so that they can come in and enjoy it as much as you do and thank you very much for being here and enjoying it being a treat good this place has everything I love to see in a garden it's bringing local community together to preserve botanic Heritage and improve public space you can't get much better than that so I suppose there's a lesson for all of us stay curious out there you never know what could be right under your nose [Music] thank you,,,,
UBw-1lcFZno,Community gardens in Northern Australia,https://youtu.be/UBw-1lcFZno,Bringing the rainforest back | Native plants | Gardening Australia,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzzsltdnAgTMSlPOvjko_Dw,Gardening Australia,2020-08-14T09:00:14Z,Jenny Adams has created a rainforest and garden oasis from “the cheapest block in Kiama that nobody wanted” – a ...,,[Music] spectacular isn't it this is the climber blowhole on the south coast of new south wales it's a picture postcard location and it's a postcard of the climber blowhole sent in from a viewer that has brought me to this place she writes to tell me of an open garden that she went to that is a truly unique patch of earth and i can't wait to see it when we bought the block 28 years ago it had been a farm so it was all grass and there was lantana in the creek edges and up the sides and probably three little patches of scrub about to here probably not so many dogs either no [Music] jenny adams is a speech pathologist and dedicated home gardener along with husband warwick she lives on a three-quarter acre block divided by a creek this creek setting looks fantastic i know i love it you know at the time we bought the block it was the cheapest block in kyama i think the values just saw it as a drain and it was we've dug a channel and over the years it's just broadened out and the native ferns have come back and it's beautiful i'm lucky because i've got enough room to have my rainforest section have my fern section and have some veggies and some cottage gardening things and i think growing the herbs close to the house has been very nice as well jenny's from pioneering stock and her forebears opened up parts of the surrounding area the hand marshes on my mother's side were some of the earliest farmers in the region at the time the rainforest went from the escarpment right to the ocean and they chopped it down and on my father's side there were saw millers dad was a sawmiller when he was young his father before him so the aim has been to recreate the rain forest and put back what was taken i want to fill this canopy here i've planted a red cedar on the other side of the house and i've got a red cedar here and we've got white cedars as well because they're the indigenous trees of the area so it's a lot of the stuff that you've planted it's now forming seed that's that's starting to germinate actually it is i've put in a few bangalow palms and they are coming everywhere they're just beautiful palms and these tree ferns here have just come up themselves that's a gorgeous little road too you've got a lot of other things i see like the bleeding heart and there's a lot of sandpaper figs too which they're endemic to this space as well yes and they've just come up themselves fantastic i can see a very large fig is that part and parcel of the block when you arrived actually it was that was the only tree and it was a huge fig there's another big tree at the top that was a tiny sapling we noticed and i had no idea it would become that beautiful big eucalypt that it is gorgeous and i have just spotted a giant stinging tree and i couldn't believe it because they only come up when it's a very healthy rainforest up in the distance i can see some very big culverts i guess there's a lot of water that gets captured and comes zooming down this creek when it rains there does it rolls down you get that natural stability of the the creek banks because of all the plants that you've got in here yeah and the big thing was once we stopped mowing and whippersnipping to the edge it all came up [Music] what jenny's done here proves you don't need a big budget to have a big garden [Music] i'm always getting second hand plants or cuttings off people and the community garden propagates a lot of natives i've been able to get a lot of good plants from them i've got my rule of has to be recycled so i'll look in fates or on the side of the road on the tip it makes for a very organic and personalized feel too yes the children who come for speech pathology enjoy all my little collections so i've got to stop but too many things now if you're attempting to restore an area with indigenous species as jenny is doing here it's handy to get some advice from an expert let me say i reckon jenny married well because her sister-in-law is an ecologist and an expert on the plants of this region she knows what to plant i have a native pepper bush this is a beautiful small shrub that naturally occurs up the east coast of australia it gets these beautiful pink new growth in the stems and it gets beautiful fleshy fruit but the really great thing about it is that you could use the leaves as a pepper substitute you must be pretty proud of what jenny's got going on here at her house i'm very proud of jenny's garden local native plants are great in many ways they're great because they're great for a local environment they support our local flora and fauna and for the gardener they're just the best outcome because they're locally adapted to our local soils and rainfall regimes and temperatures and so on must be handy having someone like jetta on hand to help you out yeah i've had a lot of input from friends and family over the years but having jetta's been the best because of her amazing knowledge and in the future i know that i can call on her and and now i'm doing a good [Music] job you've done such a good job here jenny from what it was to what it is now you must have such a great sense of achievement what i do actually because so much of the land was cleared and i feel like i've been able to put back here regenerate what was before and it gives me just enormous pleasure look it's a fantastic effort and it's something you should be proud of cheers thank you,,,,

than in the fridge. Hi, I’m Lisa. Welcome to our community garden,
where we grow approximately 490 kilos of fresh produce
for the community each year. Come along, let me show
you how we do it. Before we look at our garden,
let's talk about victory gardens. So, victory gardens 
are gardens that were put together after the
Second World War, with the help of the government,
and basically formed the basis of many
community gardens. Hey Marta, can you tell us
what a victory garden is? It was part of the war effort,
and the government in Britain, asked people to grow
vegetables on any kind of common or unused land
and they grew them, grew stuff in places where
stuff had ever been grown — schools and parks, and in the end they produced
40 per cent of the vegetables that got eaten during the second
part of the Second World War. Because everyone thought it was
their way of fighting the Nazis. It would be great if everyone
thought, you know, that climate change was
as serious as the Nazis. This bunch
looks really great. I think it's got a good mix
of different herbs that people will use and we really have tried to
keep it looking like a commercial bunch of herbs so that people who are getting food relief from food packages
can experience food dignity, where they know that they're getting food
that has been cared for and that is nutritious. This is our crop plan for Oakhill Farm. It's our take on the planning that would have been
used for a victory garden. So we've got an actual
plan of the site with the beds all numbered. Then we've got a calendar month
across the top here and the numbers of the
beds going down and then what's growing
each bed each month. So the crop plan is really good
because it's a visual way to show what's going
on in your garden or farm. It can be easily interpreted by people coming in and they
know what to expect in the garden — what's been grown in the past, what's currently growing, and what we plan
to grow in the future. So as you can see, we're on
a regular suburban house block. The garden beds are made
from IBC containers, which are about cubic metre. They're typically used to store
anything from olive oil to chemicals. We've chosen these ones
to be food grade, so we know they've only stored olive oil
or food grade products. We've cut them in half and then we have filled the bottom with scoria, a porous rock, to about here. We've put a blanket, a
geofabric blanket on top to stop the dirt falling down. And then we've filled the rest
with good quality soil. So this has created what's
called a wicking bed, We’ve then got a little irrigation pipe that we fill with water,
and it creates like a pond here. So this strengthens our plants
because they take the water up from their roots. And this is a really efficient system. It's efficient with water and also making sure our produce
is really strong and healthy. So we're going to harvest the Salanova cut-and-come-again lettuce. So we have to be really careful that we've got the whole plant gathered in our hands,
that we don't cut it to low to the soil
or it won't resprout. So we have about this height. So we'll find here that we'll
actually end up with the leaves resprouting, hopefully within the next month or so. And even if you were at home,
you might only cut off the outer leaves,
just for your salad. It's much better
to have your food stored in the garden
and growing in the garden than in the fridge, This bed here has fennel, which
is nearly ready to harvest. It's growing really well but we did have some patchiness where some of the fennel didn't take. So we've infilled that
with lettuce, which grow well with fennel, just to make sure we're
utilising this garden beds. [Alright, this one is
well and truly stuck.] All of this is edible you take the yellow bits off, but all the tips you can cut
up and put in a salad or you would chop up and put in
a pesto would be really nice. You can make fennel soup, the bulb was just delightful
to cook in any way you like. It’s tea time, everyone! So we all work together to look after the community
gardens here, and we all benefit
from sharing produce and sharing time
with people in our community. And I think that just adds
a slightly different spin to the original victory garden concept. That’s it for harvesting today, great job. Thanks for visiting us and we hope you visit your
local community gardens soon.",,,,

He told me about his market farming operation and we've stayed ...",,"- Five years ago, I met a guy named Andrew at a farm-to-table dinner, and today, we are at his farm, which he manages all by himself while working 35 hours a week, and grossing over six figures a year. I see him over there. You're gonna love this tour. Let's go find him. - What's going on, man?
(Kevin laughs) - Hey, what's up?
(laughing) - Snuck up on me there. - I know, I know, what are you up to? Cultivating? - Yeah, just getting
the cultivation going. - [Kevin] Dude, this place looks amazing. - [Andrew] Appreciate it, man.
- [Kelvin] It really does. - [Andrew] Thanks.
- What is it, like an acre, a little over?
- A Little over an acre. - [Kevin] Yeah.
- [Andrew] Yeah. - [Kevin] And it's all you? - [Andrew] All me, all me out here. 165, 50 foot beds. - [Kevin] That's crazy. - [Andrew] Yeah.
- That is crazy. I still can't believe that
you do it all yourself, it's bizarre, it's bonkers to me. 'Cause you look this far,
and damn, it keeps on going. - [Andrew] It's out there. - [Kevin] Let's just go right here, talk about classic bed prep, and-- - [Andrew] Yep.
- How does it all work? - Yeah, so my standard beds, as you can see it here, I stake 'em out at 30 inch wide. - Which is the market gardener standard. - Which is the market
garden, 18 inch centers. - Yep. - So it gives us plenty to go down a wheelbarrow with, whatever, and then pretty much,
everything's super intensive. So nothing ever goes empty. - [Kevin] Lettuce row here.
- Classic lettuce row, these are those cut and come against. These are beautiful, this is
actually gonna be harvested for the market this weekend.
- These are perfect right now. - Yeah. - How are you harvesting
these guys by yourself? - [Andrew] All by hand. - So you're just using
a knife, and just... - One knife. (mimicking cutting noises) Cut and come again. Especially with the head
lettuces, I just like to... I mean, I can burn through this thing, and then they all was
just cut super clean, ready to rock and roll. - Yeah. - Behind us, we have
some overwintered carrots that are starting to explode. Let's see, we put these guys in... These are a little later.
- Yeah. - So, I put these in in November. - Okay.
- Yeah, so these are littler guys. - Nice shape on this. - Yeah, these are those Mokum's. - Whoopees.
(both laughs) Snapped.
- Yeah, super, super sweet. - You gotta give it that bite test. - Super sweet, got the crunch. - Ooh, that's nice. - Yeah, yeah the Mokum's are really nice, and they're super fast, 55 days. So, that's why I like
'em, and then they... And then the thing I like about 'em too, is you can actually harvest
'em in these pencil size. - So, water carrots,
they'll take a lot of time to get to size and then
they'll get funky, and, but these, you just-
- I feel like a chef might like that, or maybe just a home cook might like it. It's a different shape.
- Exactly. - Kind of nice.
- You don't have to peel 'em, you don't have to do anything with 'em. - So talk to me about the
land, like when you got here, what'd you have to do? Because it's been you
the whole time, right? Nobody else?
- Been me the whole time. Yeah.
- So you, like when you first came here, you did all these rows? - I started building 'em all. - Really?.
- By hand. - So you didn't like expand
over the years type thing. You were just like, boom, I'm in. - [Andrew] No, no, I
did expand a little bit. - [Kevin] A little bit,
okay, got it, got it. - So like I did 20 rows one
week, 20 rows the next week, and then second year, I started coming down this back side here, and then third year, I opened up a 20 more rows in that back. - Wow.
- So yeah, year by year, I just kinda keep adding
little chunks here, trying to really utilize my space here as much as I can. - [Kevin] What'd you do for soil? Amendments, et cetera
when you started out? - I used a lot of mineral
dust in the very beginning. - Yeah.
- Composted the crap outta everything. 'Cause this soil here, not in this particular area, this is pretty good, but more towards the hoops there's a really, really
drained out rocky area, so I had to really load up compost. - [Kevin] Right, yeah. - So I use 30 yards roughly every year. - Okay. - Every bad slip, if it gets emptied, gets a whole new compost layer, about an inch layer on there. - Every single time. - Every single time.
- Yeah, okay. - So it gets composted maybe twice, three times a year. - So is that your biggest input besides perhaps seeding I guess, is composting or maybe water? - [Andrew] Water and compost, yeah. - [Kevin] Yeah, yeah.
- And then I use a true organics pelleted fertilizer as well. - Okay, yeah. - Which is a seven, five, seven, just a nice all purpose slow release. - Yeah, I wanna know like routine. Because you're telling me
you do it all yourself, which is sort of unbelievable honestly, even though I know it's true. (both laugh) But not only that, but you're doing it at
maybe 35, 40 hours a week. - Yep.
- So it's less, honestly less than almost
everyone's office job. - For sure, for sure. - Which is crazy to me. - Yeah, so like these beds
right behind you for instance, had broccoli in it two weeks ago. It was overwintered broccoli. I cut 'em down to the
surface, let the roots go in. I lay the compost on, and put tarp on for a week. Boom, after that tarp was on, I undid it-- - Yeah. - Raked it out, and then I literally just
direct seeded into it, put the tarp right side up, - Yeah.
- Two days later, we're here. - Are you starting in
transplanting anything, or are you direct sourcing everything? - Yeah, so I direct soil arugula, and mesculin, carrots, beets-- - Anything you can, right? I would imagine you would
prefer to direct sell. - Yeah, I have a small
greenhouse at my house. - Okay.
- A little 10 by 20. - Yeah.
- So, I can't, I'd love to transport
beets and things like that, I just don't have the space.
- Yeah, sure. - So I direct seed those things, but things like these tomato starts, I started all these guys,
and then I up planted 'em, so, these are actually from Brad Gates-- - Oh, no way.
- Up at Wild Boar Farms. - [Kevin] What variety?
- [Andrew] Afternoon delight. - [Kevin] Okay, I haven't grown that one. - [Andrew] Is the purple. See that purple guy?
- Yeah. - How are you doing, like the Florida weave on this then? Just a...
- No. No, this is kind of like, I don't know. The guys in Monterey taught
me this little system. I just pretty much tie one end-- - Yeah.
- Loop it, and then I'll have six different strings, or five different strings, and then I come in,
- Yeah. - And I just-
- You just do... Oh, that's interesting. - See this nice little tie? - You do this little
sandwich off right here. - Called tie wind.
- Keep it nice and taut. Yeah.
- And then these taut. - And then you'll just
go up every six inches, eight inches,
- Every six inches? - And you just do another.
- Yep. - That's like a big difference, huh? - This is actually an example of a row-- - Sure.
- That was an old mesculin. I tarped it, composted it, roots are still decaying in there. - Yeah, so you're not ripping out. - And then stick tomatoes
straight back in there. So this stuff's alive. They go pretty quick. If you rub your hands on that, they're just gone.
- Yeah. - They're in there and that's carbon. - Packed into the soil. Yep, totally.
- That's carbon. And so that's kind of
another, I don't look at it as necessarily a cover cropping system, but it definitely does add. - It kind of is. Yeah, it is.
- 'Cause every week, their goin' straight back into the ground. - You're taking the top
two thirds of plant matter and selling it off, and then the bottom one third you're just letting go. - Yep, and a lot of time I'll let it do a little growth again, and then I'll drop it and let it sit. - Yeah, how many seasons
have you turned here? - Six or seven probably.
- Oh shoot. - Especially with the direct seated stuff. - Really?
- I'm constantly... Every single week, I seed the arugula, salad, and mesculin.
- Yeah. - Every single week. - Have you seen your
need for inputs go down, like composts go down at all, as if improving with time? - Not yet, certain rows, definitely. - Yeah, yeah, like the
heavier turned rows perhaps. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. More input on 'em. But certain areas like
up on that far side. Definitely just gonna have to keep on it. I think eventually, for sure we'll be able to back off. - But you know, if you're a market farmer, and you're trying to buy in inputs-- - Yep. - Obviously, you're using
SPV soils, but quality-wise, what are you looking for? - Quality-wise, I always ask the testing of carbon and nitrogen as a ratio. - Yeah. - So that seeding ratio is crucial. - Yeah, do you care about
like an MPK count on it, or not really? - No.
- Yeah. - No, I do care about the diversity, so like this one,
- Of input? - Yeah, so I know SPV uses a
lot more manure-base, cow-base. So like probably next year, I'll go with the chicken farmer up here, and do more of a chicken compost-base. - Oh, so you'll switch your supplier based on input if you can't
get it from one place, yeah. - That, and just to create
more of that diversity. - Yeah, sure. - Instead of just loading
in a bunch of phosphorous, phosphorous, phosphorous. - We've been using them for all
of our raised bed stuff too. - Yeah. - Like all the in ground
compost in the backyard. - Yeah. - Like my version of this market farm, which is certainly not on the same scale, but, yeah.
- Yeah. - Dude, it's amazing. - So these are those Chandlers
I was telling you about. These are second year Chandlers. - Ooh, oops.
- Sorry. But yeah, Dude, these
things are going crazy. These are Chandlers, these
are super popular in Monterey. - Wow.
- Yeah, these things are just goin' off, you know. - That's like classic.
- Yeah. - These are cool. I honestly saved these
initially, just for myself, 'cause I just love this fine texture. The super sweet, - [Kevin] Nice shape.
- Shape. - [Kevin] Yeah.
- They don't have great shelf life though. So for a market berry, it's not too good.
- It's tough, it's tough. - I'll harvest 'em Friday, and take 'em to market Saturday. And they're starting to go. - Really? Okay.
- So unless you're doing like farm stand straight out. - Maybe this is like a ""you
pick"" berry then, right? - Or a ""you pick"" berry.
- Bring 'em here. Yeah.
- Exactly. - Okay, where should we go next? - And then, let's see. Well we got--
- We can talk covers. You got this shade cover over here I want to talk about. - Yeah, so these guys, just the next succession
of a lettuce planting that we just kind of went
over in that other area. - Are you always shading it in the first like week or so, or? - [Andrew] Anything 75 and above, yeah. I'll go ahead and shade it all out. For two weeks.
- Two weeks, yeah. - Two weeks.
- Let it establish, yeah. - Yep, and then I'll let it uncover. I'll uncover it for a night. - Do you have like a
particular shade that you like? - This looks like--
- 40%. - Yeah.
- I did do 30%, but out here in Monterey, or not Monterey, yeah, out here in Ramona, I think that the sun's a
little bit more intense up here with a little elevation. Tense heat. - Yeah, dude, it's narly up here. - We get hot, we get cold.
- It's hot, it's cold though. Yeah, that's the thing,
it's hot and it's cold. - We get hot, we get cold,
and we get super windy. - Where I'm at, it's like, we're at like 45-ish lows,
and maybe we'll touch 100. - Yeah.
- Maybe. - Yeah. - So, I'm sure yours is, what are you like 25 to
110 or something like that? - Pretty much, yeah.
- Yeah. When are you using this bed prep method where you're sort of plopping, what like silage tarp or something on top? - This in particular I'm using, because you see that mint?
- Yeah. (Andrew laughs)
Oh, sure, yeah. - That mint was coming in on all the rows, and so, I'm using these
guys more or less a barrier. So, these are gonna kill
off that mint right here. - Yep.
- And then not go anymore. - What are you gonna throw on these? - I'm trying to get some
damn summer squash in here, but with this-- - This one looks like a big plant, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, well that big... Every 18 inches or so, and then I got cucumbers popping in here. - Oh there they are. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And they're starting to pop, but earwigs in this
time of year are nasty, so we do a lot of replanting. But this stuff's going crazy. - That's popping off.
- Yeah. And then I gotta clear this out, and then put something else there. - Yeah, yeah, 'cause this is a bed. - This is a bed.
- Right, or was for a while. (both laugh)
- Exactly. Just overtaken.
- Yeah. - Then I got some baby
eggplants in this going on. - Nice. - In here is gonna be... I think some more lettuce heads, so these are Little
Jim lettuces back here. So these were all planted on Monday. - [Kevin] So you're just
using a very simple, just hoop and-- - Yeah, pretty much.
- Hoop and Shade. - Hoop and shade and rock. - Yeah, nothing. - The trick is, you
gotta get 'em big enough so the hoops are about five feet. So they get nice.
- Yeah. So they actually cover over.
- This is a pretty cool crop. This is a nice spinach crop coming in. - Yeah, that is nice. You have a variety on this? - [Andrew] That is a regiment. - [Kevin] It's looking good. - These two were beds
that were experiments, that I just kind of pushed. I was using this little section, you can see I shade out early here. And so I was kind of using
that as my chew over here, and I'm hoping to push 'em to end of June. - Yeah, with that tree, and that cover right there,
it looks like it makes sense. It's just one of those like
tiny little farmer things that you think about, right? - Exactly.
- Ooh, there's that tree. - Look at the tree right there. - Okay, I'll put something
cold and loving there. - Totally a farmer thing to think about. - Let's check out down here, man. 'Cause this is like almost
none of the farm we've seen. - [Andrew] Yeah, exactly. We've seen a block.
- Yeah. - One block of the farm. - How do you keep track of everything? Just all in your head,
or you got like journals and notes and stuff? - I got journals.
- Yeah. - I got planting journals,
things like that. I mean, the direct seeded stuff's so easy that it's every week, so it's only--
- Yeah. - That's stuff I keep out. But I keep on track of all
of my broccoli plantings, my pepper plantings, all that. Making sure I'm getting adequate amounts. - Yeah, is this just salanova here? - Another salanova.
- Yeah. One of the most expensive
lettuce seeds out there. (both laugh) - Yeah, it's going crazy.
- Isn't it? It still is, right?
- Oh, my gosh. - Yeah.
- So I actually, this is actually a cool one from you. and so Vitalis--
- Yeah. - Remember that one time
you went to Vitalis seeds, and those one cuts, and I asked you? Boom, there they are. - Oh, really? - Yeah, these are easy.
- No way. - These are easy cuts.
- Okay, nice. - These aren't the salanovas. So I went with it because of the money. And these are performing just as good. - Seems like the market garden crowd made the salanovas just too expensive. - It's so insane.
- And there's so many varieties coming out every year, that there's gotta be
something right, that works. - Exactly.
- Yeah. - And you'll find it. And I found them, and they're here. These ones are cool. These are green garlics
that we're pulling in. - Oh, you're going green.
- Yeah. So this little half row,
I did green garlics, and then we did some regular onions here. So I just kind of keep
mowing it down, and-- - So you're just gonna chop 'em and sell 'em for the tops then, yeah. - Yeah, so I just yank 'em.
- Yeah. - I yank 'em, and we
use 'em for the bases. - This is what I say, 'cause we are, my garlic just got hit by rust like crazy. - Yeah.
- And I'm like, Eh, it's just green garlic. That's why I grew it,
you know what I mean? Just make up an excuse.
- Yeah, let's cut the top off. - Yeah. - Yeah, mine are starting to burn a bit, because they are actually gonna start bulbing
here in the next month. - Yeah.
- So they'll start dying back. - I mean, you can tell it's already starting to go.
- Exactly. - Starting to separate, yeah.
- And it smells. Green garlic's my favorite thing. And this variety here, I've saved and, I've
grown and saved this seed for seven years now. It came for me with Monterey. And I brought it down, and I just been slowing
adapting it to my climate. - Yeah.
- Because it's the only soft deck variety that I
found that works down here. - [Kevin] Really?
- [Andrew] Yeah. - [Kevin] Interesting.
- [Andrew] And so-- - [Kevin] What's the variety name? - [Andrew] It's just an early Italian. - Yeah, but now, seven years
now, it's sort of your variety. - Exactly, now it's--
- Honestly, yeah. - Indian summer farms. (laughs) - Andrew Indian summer garlic. Yeah, that's wild.
- So, it's pretty cool. - So you'll just let some grow
out completely then, right? - This row I'll let... So that garlic row, I'll let it bulb out. - Yeah.
- So I have a full one there, and then way back yonder, you see those tops over there. - Right over there, yeah.
- I have one back there. - So one of those two is your
seed garlic for next season, the rest is harvested out?
- Exactly. - Yeah, want to check out a hoop house? - Let's check it out.
- Let's do it. You're telling me you're
adding one more a year? - Every year we're adding a hoop house. That's my goal.
- Yeah. - We just added this
one here in the corner about a month ago. This whole area's gonna
be my pepper block. - Yo, look at this prod fork though. - Yeah. - What kind of prod fork is this? (Andrew laughs) Frankenfork? - So yeah dude, so my father-in-law, my father-in-law, he was at
an East Gate sale in Ojai. He lives in Ojai.
- Yeah. - And he came by this thing, and the guy was like, ""You know what it is?"" He was like, ""Yeah, of course I do."" - Yeah.
- And the guy was like, ""Since you know what it is, ""I'll sell it to you for ten bucks."" - That's a deal. Cheapest prod fork I've ever heard of. (both laugh) - Yeah, I try not to get
the tie-ins too far, dude, 'cause you see how
monstrous those things are. - They're huge, dude. - So I go about halfway in, and yeah. - 'Cause you're prod forking
and that's it, right? You're no tilling, no
disturbing besides that, right? - Yeah, pretty much, prod fork and raking. - Yeah. - [Andrew] So like these,
I just planted today. - [Kevin] Yeah.
- These are the sakuras. So these are gonna be those long cherries. They'll get trellised up
on these little wires here. - This is where you're saying
you go with the single liter, 'cause it's easier to pick.
- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let the tresses get nice and taut.
- But they're spaced kind of close together, no? - Yeah, I do 100 of 'em
right here in the middle at about 18 inches apart,
18 inches on centers. Pretty tight, but-- - It works, clearly.
- It works, yeah. - Yeah, well I guess
if you go single liter and trim 'em down. - Yeah, and I-- - Just take all sakuras off after. - Exactly, every week they get trimmed. Every single week they get... And these will probably go until about September or October. - And you're selling all this stuff just at farmer's markets? - Yeah, just at the Little
Italy's farmers market right now. - That's it?
- Yeah. - Only one?
- Only one. - Oh shoot, dude, why
not anything up here? Not much of a market? - Not as much market. I'm building that structure over there, actually, that one I was talking about, where I was gonna sell tomato starts and strawberry starts out of. - We're gonna be starting
a farm stand out here too. - Okay.
- So I'll be opening it up probably Wednesday when my daughter goes to daycare, and then--
- Yeah, it makes sense. - Start selling it here.
- Everyone I talk to with the market farm thing... You're so interesting to me, because you figured out a way
to do it with, by yourself. So you're not incurring
tons of labor costs, which is like almost always
what people run into. But you somehow also
figured out how to do it without going 80, 100 hours a week, and just like that's your life, you live in the soil.
- For sure. - Which is a really interesting blend. So what have you had to give up, of like the classic market farmer best practices or whatever? What have you had to not do? - I mean, you can see out here, I keep things a little wild. - Yeah, yeah. - I like that kind of stand. I don't keep tip-top tight.
- Yeah. - I do let things go a little bit if there's areas I know I'm gonna tarp, and soon they're gonna let 'em go, and I think that type of stuff is-- - [Kevin] You're doing
something if it's necessary. - [Andrew] Exactly, only a necessity. - Not if it looks good or whatever. Not that it doesn't look good.
- Right. - To be clear.
- Right. - But just, you do see those market farms where it's like--
- Proceed. - There's nothing, there's nothing. - There's no weeds.
- Yeah. - But I actually like some weeds, because it's rooted in the ground. That's my whole motto,
is I want things covered. I want roots in the ground. I don't, out here in
this kid of arid climate, if it's too empty, it
gets dusty, it gets hot. It gets, so I kind of want some greenery. - It's kind of interesting, the idea of just letting the natural weeds creep through the pathways. - Creep through the pathways.
- 'Cause otherwise, 'cause you're gonna trample 'em, they'll break down, they'll die, whatever, so it's kind of nice, right? - Exactly, and I'll, with
something like these, you just kind of-- - Just give it that little touch. - Just give it a little
touch and they'll be toast. - Yeah.
- After that. - Especially in this heat, man. - So we planted some
peppers in here today. These are little habenaros on the side. - Oh nice. - And of course some lacienados. Yeah, I actually have
starts going right now. I'm planting kale, chard, any of my like pole and bundle greens, I plant those every three to four months-- - Just regardless, yeah.
- Just regardless. Just to keep a fresh batch going, keep it nice and strong.
- [Kelvin] Yeah. - [Andrew] And then if an old batch does keep rocking and rolling-- - [Kelvin] Just let it rip.
- Let it rip. Keep pulling, keep harvesting, boom. It's kinda that little insurance policy. As you know, just
successioning everything. - Why not? - That's where the whole
thing was, is like-- - Like this lettuce here-- - Yeah, this is gonna get all mowed out. So this was a example of frost damage. So these were all Lacienados, and this whole back area was planted with broccoli and lacienado. And with that frost that came through here two
weeks ago, smothered 'em. The coldest night, you know, I was like, oh, I'm not gonna cover 'em. They'll be fine.
- [Kelvin] Yeah. - [Andrew] One night I don't cover. - So how did you start? You just look at this today, and you're like, okay, this
guy's on another level. Obviously it didn't start out that way. - Yeah, yeah, I mean, the first years, you just start super small, super tight. Do what you can, do managing. I worked a full-time
night job on top of that. So I came out here during
the day, worked night. Maidens meets that way. - [Kelvin] Just to put like
a down-payment or a lease or take out a new loan
or anything like that. - No, no loans, I don't do nay loans, I don't wanna put any pressure
on me in terms of that way. Everything was, if I didn't
have the cash I didn't buy it - Yeah. - Of course, I could have all
the fancy tools in this nap, but I just found what I
needed and I went with it and yeah, so I just kinda
say, super, super low cost, keep my cost production as low as I can so I can sell things as
most profitable as you can. - Good point, yeah, 'cause
you price it however you want. Obviously a market bears what it bears but you'll be able to be
more competitive, I guess. - Exactly, exactly, and have the margins a little bit tighter and the other thing is just like this hoop houses, I couldn't go out and
buy more at one time. - [Kelvin] Sure. - Several year, I just
keep adding, I keep adding. This year I plan on
adding irrigation system, every year I try to add an upgrade that's gonna take me to do less. - Yeah.
- If that make sense. - It reminds me when I
like used to be addicted to like ""SimCity"" or something like that, like every year, you get
enough in the budget, you upgrade the roads,
you upgrade the plumbing. - Exactly.
- Whatever. - What seems to be the next necessity. - Yeah, totally. Irrigation is next you're saying now? - Yeah, irrigation is next, I spend a lot of time
flipping a little dials. So that's my next thing, is I
wanna automate it completely in that way I can just
refer a couple of ways. - Yeah, and that'd be nice, yeah. Dude, well, thanks for showing it to us. - Yeah. - I'm glad I got to come
up here, super inspiring, especially if you're
watching like no debt, 30, 40 hours a week, six figure business. - Six figure business. - Living out here, just chilling. Not chilling, sorry, not chilling.
- Not chilling. - Yeah, right now we're chilling. - Right now we're chilling, exactly. - I did not catch you on
a chill day earlier today but, dude, it's awesome, it's beautiful. - It's gratifying and I mean, if I can encourage anybody to it I will, we need more small farms
like this to do it. - Thanks for having us,
dude, I really appreciate. - Thanks for coming, guys. - Yeah, of course. Indian summer farm guys,
good luck in the garden, and keep on growing.",,,,

Manager Harrison Phillips taking ...,,welcome back to Australia by design where I have my dream job of searching the country for the very best landscape architecture right now Sean's in Brisbane to visit a very hot contender we're spillage is a a unique project it's actually privately owned but open to the public it uses such a diverse mix of planting that for people from Sydney they look at and think wow that's a bit much but it really is a fun place to be for Chrisman locals West End is darlinghurst to Sydney Brunswick of Melbourne North Wichita it's a mixture of indigenous australians multiculturalism and student activism but the era is changing young families and urban professionals are moving in and so where Steen has to evolve this is West Village common this is bang smack in the middle of it all so caught me crazy and I know you spend a lot of money on the space but it doesn't look very architectural yeah we love hearing that fraud from the outset for us we didn't want an architectural design it was a landscape driven approach to creating a beautiful community garden a big part of what we were trying to achieve here was just softening to boundary street and it's a really hot arid environment boundary street so the key moves about putting the water onto the street the generosity of the trees and the planting so these trees weren't here when you started six months ago there was nothing here this was an old admin building built in the 80s horrible thing so we made way for this beautiful park lands about six months ago and these trees are about 30 years old it's a 24 hour space and it's a really unique space you'll see in the garden here a little bit later the lights will come on and it's surrounded by beautiful retail and nighttime activities as well tell us the story about the chocolate at the bottom of the ice cream drumstick the drumstick was actually made in this factory behind this the 1928 Peters ice cream factory that Queensland icon is actually an era and it was it was a casting problem when they made the cone the chocolate dripped down and set in the bottom the kind so absolutely fundamental to what we're doing here is all about restoring part of place for the factory this building has a lot of social and cultural significance for Brisbane a lot of people worked here in the early 1920s it lost its identity so a big part of what we've done here is restore its engagement with our community and build a beautiful park going around it so when you're eating your chocolate at the bottom of the drumstick this is where it started there's a lot of effort and expense gone to this garden I think you've cheated by 20 years I hear ya we've got out and sourced 50 very advanced trees from all over Queensland and New South Wales and brought them in to the site to establish this forest all the inspiration comes from the native forest that was here 200 years ago beautiful forests and full of native vegetation and we've tried to recreate parts of that so we end up with a really rich canopy in a really rich understory it's an expensive way to do it isn't it it is shaundra we had a short time frame and just look at the outcome it's fantastic it is beautiful in it and tell us about the big garden gnomes they're in the garden I say they're not really garden gnomes I'm sorry that's right wonderful pieces of art created by Bromley & Co it's pretty unusual to see that level of n ornamentation and decoration and civic spaces normally they're much bigger pieces and much more still you know boring and dull there's they're quite rich they are instead of having one large piece we wanted to have a whole range of artwork throughout the forest and artwork that kids could relate to and pieces that were intimate and memorable so water is a big part of this landscape it is Sean the water it provides activation it also provides cooling and some great play opportunities for kids it's certainly very cool in here and there's also thousands of Lights in the garden yes two and a half thousand to be precise we call it the field of life modern civic spaces are often dull and inspiring and ordered and in Queens Ain put heat into the picture and they're awful places by contrast this beautiful well detailed welcoming and cool garden is a revelation with only two spots left in the top 10 which two projects have the judges selected to go through to the final episode West Village Brisbane has got through which is good to see it's something that is different for that area but at the same time able to be used by so many different groups of people it's a great example of Brisbane Landscape Architecture and how a small park can create a little oasis in the city show no remembrance has made it to the top 10 I'm happy about this one here it was so well put together it's a really great example of how Landscape Architecture can can affect us on a really personal level by extending the whole experience of the shrine well there you have it with West Village Brisbane and Melbourne shrine of remembrance both selected by our judges to be a part of our top 10 we are good to go next episode we count down to find Australia by designs number one landscape architectural project for the year [Music] you,,,,

increased in leaps and bounds one night a week then two nights a week so then after we started three nights a week before the maximum number 40 people then it's now 60 to 80 people so that's a double bonus for us we tell our story and we giving our our feast and we're sharing everything here so that's a very big uh happy moment for us yeah wonderful just makes me feel good i feel like i have to
