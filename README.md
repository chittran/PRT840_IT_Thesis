Project Final Report Assessment 3 - INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN APPROACHES FOR DETECTING COMMUNITY GARDENS TO SUPPORT BIOSECURITY SURVEILLANCE IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA
 

## Abstract
Biosecurity in the northern Australia (Northern Territory, north of West Australia and north Queensland), which may facilitate the spread of pets and diseases, is critically impacted by community gardens. A challenge was given when not all the community gardens are registered and monitored by the authorities. In this study, we propose a multi-method pipeline for the automated identification of community gardens across this region. First, we scrape open websites using BeautifulSoup to extract the garden listings and geocode their locations. Second, we scrape YouTube via the YouTube Data API and apply an Open AI API to video metadata and transcripts to extract community garden – related contents. Third, we use Google Earth Engine in conjunction with a YOLO-based object detector and RoboFlow to locate green plots suggestive of garden activity. We manually verified the data based on the location and contact/website. Finally, we assemble the validated records into a map-based database to support biosecurity management. Our approaches show our tools reliably finds both existing and new community gardens, offering authorities an easy and scalable tool for surveillance and control.
